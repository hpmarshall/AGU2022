	abstract = {{This research investigates the use of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture
   Radar (InSAR) to generate a time-series of snow water equivalent (SWE)
   for dry snow within the Kuparuk watershed, North Slope, Alaska, during
   the winter of 1993/1994. Maps depicting relative change in phase and the
   theoretical relative change in SWE between satellite acquisitions are
   created for 3-day periods at the end of March 1994 using both ascending
   and descending ERS-1 overpasses. The theoretical coefficient relating
   relative change in phase and relative change in SWE for C-band is found
   to be at least twice as large as what is expected when using a simple
   single-layer snow model for this study area and time period. Without any
   direct measurements of SWE on the ground, station measurements of snow
   depth and hourly wind are linked to each 3-day relative change in phase
   map. Along with a qualitative assessment, quantitative measures of the
   rate and magnitude of phase change around these stations are directly
   compared to the hourly wind data for a given 3-day period. InSAR-derived
   maps acquired around a measured precipitation event show a considerable
   relationship to the predominant direction of strong winds over each
   3-day period while maps acquired around no measureable precipitation
   depict much less correlation between phase change and predominant
   direction of strong winds. Despite limited ground measurements to infer
   snowpack conditions, these results show continued promise for the InSAR
   technique to measure changes in snowpack conditions (e.g. SWE) at much
   higher resolutions than manual sampling methods or passive microwave
   remote sensing. The extension of this technique to current L-band InSAR
   satellite platforms is also discussed.}},

@article{Guneriussen:2001,
	abstract = {{This paper describes the theoretical relation between interferometric
   phase and changes in snow water equivalent (SWE) and show results from
   experiments using ERS-1/2 tandem data. The main scattering contribution
   from a dry snow cover is from the snow-ground interface. However, the
   radar wave will be refracted in the snow. Thus, only small changes in
   the snow properties between two interferometric synthetic aperture radar
   (SAR) images will change the interferometric phase. This phase change is
   shown to introduce a significantly increase in the digital elevation
   model (DEM) height error, although no effects are observed on the degree
   of coherence. The phase change is also shown to affect the differential
   interferometric results and may wrongly be interpreted as range
   displacement.
   The presented theory and results implies that light snowfall and/or
   small changes in snow properties between interferometric SAR (InSAR)
   image acquisitions, may introduce significant height errors in DEM
   derived from glaciers, ice sheets, or bare ground, even in the case of
   high degree of coherence.
   Thus, meteorological observations in addition to degree of coherence
   must be considered when generating DEM in areas covered with snow or
   where snow fall is likely to have occurred.}},

	abstract = {{Accurately simulating the spatiotemporal distribution of mountain snow
   water equivalent improves estimates of available meltwater and benefits
   the water resource management community. In this paper we present the
   first integration of lidar-derived distributed snow depth data into a
   physics-based snow model using direct insertion. Over four winter
   seasons (2013-2016) the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA/JPL) Airborne Snow
   Observatory (ASO) performed near-weekly lidar surveys throughout the
   snowmelt season to measure snow depth at high resolution over the
   Tuolumne River Basin above Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in the Sierra Nevada
   Mountains of California. The modeling component of the ASO program
   implements the iSnobal model to estimate snow density for converting
   measured depths to snow water equivalent and to provide temporally
   complete snow cover mass and thermal states between flights. Over the
   four years considered in this study, snow depths from 36 individual
   lidar flights were directly inserted into the model to provide updates
   of snow depth and distribution. Considering all updates to the model,
   the correlation between ASO depths and modeled depths with and without
   previous updates was on average r(2) = 0.899 (root-mean-square error =
   12.5 cm) and r(2) = 0.162 (root-mean-square error = 41.5 cm),
   respectively. The precise definition of the snow depth distribution
   integrated with the iSnobal model demonstrates how the ASO program
   represents a new paradigm for the measurement and modeling of mountain
   snowpacks and reveals the potential benefits for managing water in the
   region.
   Plan Language Summary In regions that depend primarily on snow to
   support life, water availability is becoming an increasingly important
   topic. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Airborne
   Snow Observatory (ASO) is a new platform for estimating the amount of
   water stored in mountain snowpacks. Since 2013, the ASO has combined
   detailed measurements of snow depth from an aircraft with snowpack
   density estimates from a physics-based snow model to provide predictions
   of total snow water equivalent stored in the Tuolumne River Basin in the
   California Sierra Nevada. This work describes the process of updating
   the snow model using the measured ASO snow depths through a direct
   insertion process. When the distribution of all the snow in the basin is
   known more accurately, the model results are improved.}},

   single-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for
   snow-depth mapping. Maps are presented over the Tuolumne River Basin
   region of the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, and compared with those collected
   by a scanning lidar onboard the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory for the
   same region on the same snow day. For this observation, the snow surface
   was wet and melting and as such penetration of the electromagnetic wave
   into the snow volume can be effectively neglected. Despite the rugged
   terrain, heavy tree-cover, and very low snow-volume, depth maps had a
   standard deviation < 1 m with the largest differences occurring on
   slopes exceeding 40 degrees. While additional evaluation is needed with
   demonstration of the InSAR capability over a greater range of conditions

	abstract = {{Snow cover and its melt dominate regional climate and water resources in
   many of the world's mountainous regions. Snowmelt timing and magnitude
   in mountains are controlled predominantly by absorption of solar
   radiation and the distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE), and yet
   both of these are very poorly known even in the best-instrumented
   mountain regions of the globe. Here we describe and present results from
   the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), a coupled imaging spectrometer and
   scanning lidar, combined with distributed snow modeling, developed for
   the measurement of snow spectral albedo/broadband albedo and snow
   depth/SWE. Snow density is simulated over the domain to convert snow
   depth to SWE. The result presented in this paper is the first
   operational application of remotely sensed snow albedo and depth/SWE to
   quantify the volume of water stored in the seasonal snow cover. The
   weekly values of SWE volume provided by the ASO program represent a
   critical increase in the information available to hydrologic scientists
   and resource managers in mountain regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

	abstract = {A method to determine the dissipated seismic energy into the ground by a down going avalanche is presented. Evaluation of the seismic energy is useful for avalanche size classification, model validation, and for characterization and better understanding of the avalanche evolution as it propagates downhill along the changing slope. The method was applied to two different type avalanches that were released artificially on 2004/02/28 and 2005/04/15 at Ryggfonn (Norway) avalanche experimental site, operated by the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI). The analysed seismic data were recorded by the University of Barcelona seismic instruments consisting of two three-component wide-range seismometers located respectively, in the middle and on the side of the avalanche path. The energy determination requires a priori seismic characterization of the site and the knowledge of the avalanche front speed. In this paper a seismic characterization (surface wave phase velocity and amplitude attenuation factor) of the Ryggfonn site is presented. This characterization will serve for subsequent studies. We attribute the main source of seismic signals for the studied events to basal friction and ploughing occurring at the avalanche front and related to the changing slope in the propagation path, which causes high seismic energy dissipation. A comparative study of the evolution of the dissipated seismic energy with the energy generated by a simple sliding block model of constant mass was performed. The observed differences highlight the importance of ploughing and basal friction and the specific characteristics of the avalanches, such as their length and type. The difference between the calculated total dissipated seismic energy for the two similar size avalanches reflects their different flow type. As expected, the dry/mixed event dissipates a smaller amount of energy (similar to 1.2 MJ) than the dry/dense event (similar to 2.8 MJ). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Rost&Thomas:2002,
	abstract = {[1] Since their development in the 1960s, seismic arrays have given a new impulse to seismology. Recordings from many uniform seismometers in a well-defined, closely spaced configuration produce high-quality and homogeneous data sets, which can be used to study the Earth's structure in great detail. Apart from an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio due to the simple summation of the individual array recordings, seismological arrays can be used in many different ways to study the fine-scale structure of the Earth's interior. They have helped to study such different structures as the interior of volcanos, continental crust and lithosphere, global variations of seismic velocities in the mantle, the core-mantle boundary and the structure of the inner core. For this purpose many different, specialized array techniques have been developed and applied to an increasing number of high-quality array data sets. Most array methods use the ability of seismic arrays to measure the vector velocity of an incident wave front, i.e., slowness and back azimuth. This information can be used to distinguish between different seismic phases, separate waves from different seismic events and improve the signal-to-noise ratio by stacking with respect to the varying slowness of different phases. The vector velocity information of scattered or reflected phases can be used to determine the region of the Earth from whence the seismic energy comes and with what structures it interacted. Therefore seismic arrays are perfectly suited to study the small-scale structure and variations of the material properties of the Earth. In this review we will give an introduction to various array techniques which have been developed since the 1960s. For each of these array techniques we give the basic mathematical equations and show examples of applications. The advantages and disadvantages and the appropriate applications and restrictions of the techniques will also be discussed. The main methods discussed are the beam-forming method, which forms the basis for several other methods, different slant stacking techniques, and frequency-wave number analysis. Finally, some methods used in exploration geophysics that have been adopted for global seismology are introduced. This is followed by a description of temporary and permanent arrays installed in the past, as well as existing arrays and seismic networks. We highlight their purposes and discuss briefly the advantages and disadvantages of different array configurations.},

@article{Johnson&al:2013,
	abstract = {We monitored geyser activity in the Lower Geyser Basin (LGB) of Yellowstone National Park with dual four-element microphone arrays separated by similar to 600 m. The arrays were independently used to identify incident coherent plane wave energy, then conjoint cross beam back-azimuths from the two arrays were used to precisely locate signal sources. During a week in August 2011 we located repeating infrasound events, peaked in energy between 1 and 10 Hz, originating from at least five independent geothermal features, including the episodically erupting Great Fountain, Fountain and Kaleidoscope Geysers, as well as periodic infrasound from nearby Botryoidal and persistent sound from Firehole Spring. Although activity from nearby cone-type geysers was not detected in the infrasound band up through 50 Hz, the major fountain-type geysers (i.e., with columns greater than 10 m) could be detected at several kilometers, and two minor geysers (i.e., a few meters in eruption height) could be tracked at distances up to a few hundred meters. Detection of geyser activity was especially comprehensive at night when ambient noise was low. We conclude that infrasound monitoring of fountain-type geysers permits convenient tracking of geyser activity, episodicity, signal duration, energy content, and spectral content These parameters enable objective statistical quantification of geyser behavior and changes over time that may be due to external forcing. Infrasonic study of geyser activity in an individual basin has great monitoring utility and can be reasonably accomplished with two or more distributed sensor arrays. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {A catalog that characterizes sources of regional infrasound observed in the western U. S. (1 November 2010 to 31 October 2012) is produced. Data from nine University of Utah Seismograph Stations infrasonic arrays are supplemented by three additional arrays in Nevada, operated by Southern Methodist University. The detection procedure using an adaptive F-detector provides input into the Bayesian Infrasonic Source Location procedure. The catalog consists of 1510 events with indication of repeated events from many locations such as Dugway Testing Ground, Utah Test and Training Range, and New Bomb. We analyzed the relationship between seasonal variations in the event locations and wind conditions using the Ground-to-Space specifications based on publicly available operational numerical weather prediction data analysis products supplement by empirical models above 80 km. There is significant commonality between this study's bulletin and the Western United States Infrasonic Catalog published by Walker et al. (2011). A previous study utilized infrasound signals detected on the USArray Transportable Array seismic stations (2007-2008). Both results document the vast majority of events that occur during working hours, suggesting a human cause. To illustrate the utility of the event bulletin for exploring atmospheric dynamics, propagation paths of an event detected during the equinox period, when the stratospheric wind is low, were generated using a ray-tracing algorithm. We found that the observations contain stratospheric arrivals, not predicted by ray theory, possibly due to gravity waves increasing the effective jet speed.},

	abstract = {On 2005 June 13, a major earthquake (M7.8) occurred in the Tarapaca region (North Chile), within the region of high mountains. At large distances from the epicentre, this event produced coherent infrasonic waves detected by three infrasound stations that are part of the International Monitoring System. The observed azimuth variations and the long signal durations suggest that wide regions in the Andes Mountains radiated infrasonic waves. From these observations, the main sources' regions are reconstructed. Such an event recorded by multiple stations offers an unique opportunity to evaluate the relative contributions of the different source mechanisms involved in large earthquakes as well as to improve our understanding of the amplification of ground displacement caused by the topography. With a review of infrasound signals from past earthquakes, extended empirical scaling relations are derived. We show that beyond the seismic magnitude, both seismic source and topographic features also play a predominant role in the generation of infrasound.},

A three-element infrasound array 10km from the summit, and 4km from the lahar's closest approach, was used to study the flow's progression. Array processing using cross-correlation lag times and semblance places constraints on the lahar's dynamics, including detection of an initial flow pulse that traveled from 2 to 12km at an average speed of 38m/s. Subsequently, the lahar signal evolved to a relatively stationary infrasonic tremor located 10 to 12km from the vent and adjacent to a topographic notch, through which sound may have preferentially diffracted toward the recording site. This study demonstrates the powerful capabilities of infrasound arrays for lahar study and suggests their potential application for future hazard monitoring.},

Such activities are identified as moving sources, which descend several hundred meters at bulk flow speeds of up to similar to 10 m/s, which is considerably slower than the descent velocity of individual blocks. Infrasound rockfall signal character is readily distinguishable from explosion infrasound, which is manifested by a relatively fixed location source with lower frequency content. In contrast, the rockfalls of Santiaguito possess higher frequencies dominated by 7.5 to 20 Hz energy. During our observation periods typical rockfall signals occurred similar to 10 times per hour and lasted tens of seconds or more. Array beamforming permitted detection of rockfall transients with amplitudes of only a few tens of millipascals that would be impossible to distinguish from noise using a single sensor. Conjoint time-synchronized video is used to corroborate location and to characterize various gravity-driven events.},

	abstract = {On 29 May 2006 a large rockfall off the Mount St. Helens lava dome produced an atmospheric plume that was reported by airplane pilots to have risen to 6,000 m above sea level and interpreted to be a result of an explosive event. However, subsequent field reconnaissance found no evidence of a ballistic field, indicating that there was no explosive component. The rockfall produced complex seismic and infrasonic signals, with the latter recorded at sites 0.6 and 13.4 km from the source. An unusual, very long-period (50 s) infrasonic signal was recorded, a signal we model as the result of air displacement. Two high-frequency infrasonic signals are inferred to result from the initial contact of a rock slab with the ground and from interaction of displaced air with a depression at the base of the active lava dome.},

	abstract = {The ability to identify snow avalanches as they occur is essential for aggressive avalanche management in transportation corridors and is a fundamental ingredient of avalanche forecasting. Past studies have shown that moving avalanches emit a detectable sub-audible sound signature in the low frequency infrasonic spectrum. Experimental infrasound avalanche monitoring activities conducted in the United States Rocky Mountain West clarify avalanche event identification capabilities of single sensor and multiple sensor systems. Avalanche identification performance of single sensor monitoring systems vary according to ambient noise and signal levels. While single sensor auto correlation signal processing algorithms identify avalanche activity, uncertainties (i.e. false negative identifications and false positive identifications) increase as wind noise increases, and as signal levels decrease due to increasing distance or smaller sources. Monitoring with multiple sensor systems substantially improves avalanche event identification robustness under windy and noisy conditions, while also allowing location estimates of avalanche events to be made. Avalanche event identification and localization capabilities of cross correlation and semblance multiple sensor signal processing algorithms are demonstrated via a sensor array monitoring system. Also demonstrated are avalanche identification and localization capabilities of distributed networks of infrasound monitoring systems. Garnered knowledge is being ported into near real-time prototype systems that will be operated in the Jackson Hole, Wyoming region. Prototype operation will provide performance evaluations in practical highway and recreational area settings. Reliable implementation of infrasound monitoring technology to automatically identify avalanche events requires further innovative solutions to problematic ambient wind noise and interfering signals.

Changes in elevation between maps were adjusted for seasonal variations in the snow cover, and to account for the ablation between the date of photography and 1 October. Topography obtained from the laser altimetry was adjusted for snow thickness and glacier motion to estimate topography of 1 October 1995. The mass of Blue Glacier has changed less than 7 m (water equivalent) during this 56 year period which is minor compared with other glaciers in the region and elsewhere in the world. Glacier-average annual mass balances, beginning in 1956, have been calculated either from stake measurements and probing of late-season snow, or from a regression analysis using late-season measurements of the equilibrium line altitude. A comparison with the changes derived from surface maps shows values obtained from field measurements are too positive by about 0.5 m a(-1). indicating that considerable caution is needed when interpreting time series of mass balance. Two alternative time series of mess balance consistent with the long-term mass changes are created by making simple adjustments: (i) a single constant is subtracted from each value so that the series is consistent with the 1957-95 mass change; (2) one constant is subtracted from each value over 1957-87 and another is subtracted from each value over 1987-95 so that the series is consistent with both the 1957-87 and 1987-95 mass changes.

The mass balance of Blue Glacier was generally positive until the mid-1970s and negative since. The fluctuations of mass balance closely resemble those of snowfall on the glacier as estimated from the joins distribution of temperature and precipitation. The climate in western Washington was cooler and wetter during the decade before the mid-1970s, but the trend since has been towards warmer and drier conditions.},

	abstract = {Accumulation rate measurements on the East Antarctic plateau are challenging due to both spatial and temporal variability. Annual stratigraphy is often not reliably or consistently preserved in the firn, and so accumulation cannot be determined from snow pit stratigraphy. We present a suite of accumulation rate measurements collected over several seasons at Taylor Dome, East Antarctica. We compare net accumulation results from direct burial rate measurements and beta-activity firn cores along a 35 km traverse. The two methods are consistent and show that the net accumulation varies from greater than 10 cm a(-1) to about 1 cm a(-1) (ice equivalent) southwest to northeast across the dome. We map the depth of shallow radar layering to interpolate and extrapolate these point-location measurements and show that considerable variations occur over kilometer scales resulting from subtle surface topography. We also present accumulation rates estimated from concentration of the cosmogenic isotope (10)Be and from activity profiles of (210)Pb. Finally, satellite passive microwave data are used to estimate spatially averaged accumulation rates on the regional to continental scale to provide a context for these local observations. We show that robust mass balance measurements in this environment must rely on spatial and/or temporal averaging.},

	abstract = {Observations and measurements indicate rain often has a major impact on snow slope stability. Measurements to investigate the effects of wetting of low density, alpine snow were made at Snoqualmie Pass, WA, USA. Results indicate that on first wetting, the densification rate can increase by three orders of magnitude. This initial burst of densification occurs independently of the gravitational load and is probably a result of rapid structural changes and grain rearrangement that occurs when liquid water is first introduced. The rate decreases rapidly with time, although it remains about two orders of magnitude higher than that for dry snow of the same density. The rate of densification decreases as density increases. We assume snow behaves as a linear viscous fluid and that the metamorphic and gravitational components of compaction are additive. A simple model of compaction is derived empirically using the measurements. The model fits the measurements very well, although more experiments are needed to determine the dependence of the model parameters on liquid water content. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Assuming that the viscosity of this ice is primarily dependent on stress, the relationship between inferred stress and measurements of strain-rate above similar to 115 m depth suggest a constitutive relationship with a stress exponent n similar to 1. Deformation below 115 m is described by a non-linear flow law with a power exponent of approximately 3-4. A sharp transition between the two flow regimes is likely caused by a change in the dominant mechanism from superplastic flow, basal slip, and/or diffusional flow near the surface to dislocation and intragranular deformation at depth.},

	abstract = {Ground-based frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar measurements made throughout the 2002-03 NASA Cold Lands Processes (CLPX) mission in Colorado, USA, were designed to study the major electromagnetic transitions within the alpine snowpack over a wide range of conditions, and their effect on measurements made with different active radar measurement parameters. Measurements during 2002 determined that measurements at C-, X-, and Ku-band frequencies were necessary to retrieve the most snowpack information in a wide range of conditions. Measurements at four different incidence angles indicated that the snowpack layering was still visible at 15degrees but that the rough surface scattering of the snow-ground interface dominated the signal above 30degrees incidence. Measurements during 2003 were focused on characterizing the microwave response at C-, X-, and Ku-band frequencies at four different sites with different snowpack conditions, indicating that the optimal measurement parameters vary with snowpack conditions. Measurements at different bandwidths illustrate the effect of bandwidth on vertical resolution. This ground-truth data will help interpretation of air- and space-borne active and passive microwave radar measurements that were made coincident with this study. In addition, this work may help guide future researchers when choosing FMCW radar measurement parameters, depending on the type of snowpack information their study requires.

	abstract = {Large variations in both snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow slope stability are known to exist in the alpine snowpack, caused by wind, topographic and microclimatic effects. This variability makes extrapolation of point measurements of snowpack properties difficult and prone to error, but these types of measurements are used to estimate SWE and stability across entire mountain ranges. Radar technology provides a promising alternative to point measurements, because large areas can be covered quickly and non-intrusively. There is great potential for obtaining information on a large spatial scale from airborne applications. Frequency-modu fated continuous wave (FMCW) radar measurements were made from the ground in several different alpine snowpacks, along with manual and in situ electrical measurements. The surface and ground reflections from the radar data, combined with an average density estimate, can provide a useful estimate of SWE. In addition, the locations of internal reflections are highly correlated with both visually identified layers and measured changes in in situ dielectric properties.},

	abstract = {The stratigraphy of an alpine snowpack is very important for avalanche danger assessment, as well as interpretation of remote sensing measurements for hydrological purposes. Since spatial variability is often widespread, due mainly to wind, micro-climatic and topographic effects, extrapolating point measurements can be difficult. Tools which can quickly characterize snowpack stratigraphy, such as high frequency radar and mechanical probes, will be required for a complete understanding of the effects of spatial variability, however interpretation of these kinds of measurements still remains challenging. We compare measurements from a portable 8-18 GHz Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with SnowMicroPenetrometer (SMP) and standard snowpit measurements. Although significant variability existed at the sub-meter scale, major stratigraphic horizons could be followed along radar profiles and identified in SMP measurements. A very thin hard crust (0.2-0.4 mm) that was continuous caused strong signals that were identifiable in both the SMP and the radar measurements at five different sites along a 10 m traverse. Two other more subtle transitions in the SMP signal were highly correlated with the locations of radar reflections. This work suggests that combining FMCW radar measurements, to characterize snowpack geometry, with SMP measurements, to characterize mechanical properties of layers, may be a useful technique for quantifying the spatial variability of the snowpack.

	abstract = {The spatial pattern of accumulation rate can be inferred from internal layers in glaciers and ice sheets. Non-dimensional analysis determines where finite strain can be neglected ('shallow-layer approximation') or approximated with a local one-dimensional flow model ('local-layer approximation'), and where gradients in strain rate along particle paths must be included ('deep layers'). We develop a general geophysical inverse procedure to infer the spatial pattern of accumulation rate along a steady-state flowband, using measured topography of the ice-sheet surface, bed and a 'deep layer'. A variety of thermomechanical ice-flow models can be used in the forward problem to calculate surface topography and ice velocity, which are used to calculate particle paths and internal-layer shapes. An objective tolerance criterion prevents over-fitting the data. After making site-specific simplifications in the thermomechanical flow algorithm, we find the accumulation rate along a flowband through Taylor Mouth, a flank site on Taylor Dome, Antarctica, using a layer at approximately 100 m depth, or 20\% of the ice thickness. Accumulation rate correlates with ice-surface curvature. At this site, gradients along flow paths critically impact inference of both the accumulation pattern, and the depth-age relation in a 100 m core.},

	abstract = {[1] Contributions to sea level rise from rapidly retreating marine-terminating glaciers are large and increasing. Strong increases in iceberg calving occur during retreat, which allows mass transfer to the ocean at a much higher rate than possible through surface melt alone. To study this process, we deployed an 11-sensor passive seismic network at Columbia Glacier, Alaska, during 2004 - 2005. We show that calving events generate narrow-band seismic signals, allowing frequency domain detections. Detection parameters were determined using direct observations of calving and validated using three statistical methods and hypocenter locations. The 1 - 3 Hz detections provide a good measure of the temporal distribution and size of calving events. Possible source mechanisms for the unique waveforms are discussed, and we analyze potential forcings for the observed seismicity.},

This radar technology provides a promising alternative to point measurements, as properties such as snow depth can be measured quickly and non-destructively. Recent advances in microwave FMCW radar technology have resulted in lightweight, portable instrumentation. This is in contrast to the early FMCW radar systems which were often too heavy to cover large distances efficiently. These advanced FMCW radars provide snow scientists and hydrologists with the ability to map snow pack properties, such as depth, snow water equivalent (SWE) and stratigraphy, rapidly over large distances, at high resolution. We discuss the development of FMCW radar over the past 30 years and review the diverse applications of these radars by snow scientists. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The local scale observation site (LSOS) is the smallest study site (0.8 ha) of the 2002/03 Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) and is located within the Fraser mesocell study area. It was the most intensively measured site of the CLPX, and measurements here had the greatest temporal component of all CLPX sites. Measurements made at the LSOS were designed to produce a comprehensive assessment of the snow, soil, and vegetation characteristics viewed by the ground-based remote sensing instruments. The objective of the ground-based microwave remote sensing was to collect time series of active and passive microwave spectral signatures over snow, soil, and forest, which is coincident with the intensive physical characterization of these features. Ground-based remote sensing instruments included frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars operating over multiple microwave bandwidths; the Ground-Based Microwave Radiometer (GBMR-7) operating at channels 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89 GHz; and in 2003, an L-, C-, X- and Ku-band scatterometer radar system. Snow and soil measurements included standard snow physical properties, snow wetness, snow depth transects, and soil moisture. The stem and canopy temperature and xylem sap flux of several trees were monitored continuously. Five micrometeorological towers monitored ambient conditions and provided forcing datasets for 1D snow and soil models. Arrays of pyranometers (0.3-3 mu m) and a scanning thermal radiometer (8-12 mu m) characterized the variability of radiative receipt in the forests. A field spectroradiometer measured the hyperspectral hemispherical-directional reflectance of the snow surface. These measurements, together with the ground-based remote sensing, provide the framework for evaluating and improving microwave radiative transfer models and coupling them to land surface models. The dataset is archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado.},

	abstract = {Stability prediction from SnowMicroPen (SMP) profiles would support avalanche forecasting operations, since objective stability information could be gathered more quickly than with standard tests, thereby allowing sampling at higher resolution and over larger spatial scales. Previous studies have related the snow properties derived from the SMP to observed snow properties at Rutschblock (RB) and compression test failure planes. The goals of this study are to show to what extent snowpack stability for artificial triggering, based on RB. can be derived from SMP measurements and how multiple measurements at the RB scale improve the results. Measurements at 36 different sites were used for the development of a classification scheme. Each site included a RB test, a manual profile, and 6 to 10 adjacent SMP measurements, for a total of 262 SMP profiles. A recently improved SMP theory was applied to estimate the micro-structural and mechanical properties of manually defined weak layers and slab layers. SMP signal quality control and different noise treatment methods were taken into consideration in the analysis. The best and most robust predictor of RB stability was the weak layer micro-scale strength. In combination with the SMP-estimated mean density of the slab layer, the total accuracy of predicting RB stability classes was 85\% over the entire dataset, and 88\% when signals with obvious signal dampening (11\% of the dataset) were removed. The total accuracy increased when multiple SMP measurements at the RB scale were used to calculate the mean weak layer strength, when compared to using just one SMP measurement at a site. The analysis was robust to trends and offsets in the absolute SMP force, which was a frequent signal error. However, it was sensitive to dampened or disturbed SMP force micro variance. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the best predictor of instability. the weak layer micro-scale strength, was robust to the choice of SMP signal noise removal method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Lutz:2009aa,
	abstract = {Researchers and practitioners have long utilized a variety of penetrometers to investigate the snowpack. Identifying definitive relationships between penetrometer-derived microstructural information and stability has been challenging. The purpose of this study is two-fold: 1. We propose a simple field test to establish relationships between load and penetrometer-derived microstructural estimates. 2. We utilize the SnowMicroPen (SMP) to quantify changes in weak layer residual strength and microstructural dimension associated with an artificial loading event Our dataset is from Moonlight Basin, Montana and includes three modified loaded-column tests, each paired with 5 SMP profiles. Depth hoar comprised the targeted weak layer. Results indicate that loading caused the residual strength and rupture frequency to decrease significantly. Much like a compression test at a micro-scale, the force required for the SMP to rupture individual structures as well as the micro-scale strength decreased significantly when the slab stress was increased by artificially adding blocks of snow. A decrease in observed rupture frequency within the weak layer (or an increase in the distance between ruptured structures) also occurred after the loading event. probably because some structures within the weak layer had already failed or were so close to failing that the penetrometer could not detect their rupture. Due in part to the large difference in loads, microstructural differences between the natural and loaded columns were significant enough that only one profile would have been necessary to determine a significant difference in residual strength. Artificial removal of slab stress resulted in greater rupture forces and larger microstructures, likely due to elastic rebound. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Marshall:2009aa,
	abstract = {Measurements of snow using a high-resolution micropenetrometer can be used to discriminate between different snow types; in lower-density snow the signal is sensitive to microstructure, and micromechanical properties can be estimated. Although a physics-based snow penetration theory was first developed almost a decade ago, since that time the majority of studies using snow micropenetrometers have focused on using direct hardness measurements in statistical relationships. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to rigorously test the existing physics-based snow micropenetration theories over a wide range of parameters. These tests revealed four major sources of error in the inversion, which are corrected in this analysis. It is shown that this improved inversion algorithm can recover micromechanical parameters in synthetic data with much greater accuracy over the entire range of micromechanical properties observed in natural snow. Detailed examples of the inversion results are shown for eight different snow types, collected in both Alaskan and alpine snowpacks. The resulting micromechanical properties are distinctly different, indicating that a snow characterization from snow micropenetrometer estimates of micromechanical properties is likely possible. Estimates of the microscale elastic modulus, microscale strength, and structural element length make sense physically when compared to the qualitative descriptions of the different snow types. Microscale strength estimates are used to estimate macroscale strength values, and results from 33 different snow samples, covering a wide range of densities and snow types, are consistent with previously reported values from macroscale tests.},

	abstract = {Deposition of snow from precipitation and wind events creates layering within seasonal snowpacks. The thickness and horizontal continuity of layers within seasonal snowpacks can be highly variable, due to snow blowing around topography and vegetation, and this has important implications for hydrology, remote sensing and avalanche forecasting. In this paper, we present practical field and post-processing protocols for recording lateral variations in snow stratigraphy using near-infrared (NIR) photography. A Fuji S9100 digital camera, modified lobe sensitive to NIR wavelengths, was mounted on a rail system that allowed for rapid imaging of a 10 m long snow trench excavated on the north side of Toolik Lake, Alaska (68 degrees 38'N, 149 degrees 36'W). Post-processing of the images included removal of lens distortion and vignetting. A tape measure running along the base of the trench provided known locations (control points) that permitted scaling and georeferencing. Snow layer heights estimated from the NIR images compared well with manual stratigraphic measurements made at 0.2 m intervals along the trench (n = 357, R(2) = 0.97). Considerably greater stratigraphic detail was captured by the NIR images than in the manually recorded profiles. NIR imaging of snow trenches using the described protocols is an efficient tool for quantifying continuous microscale variations in snow layers and associated properties.},

Here we analyze continuous seismic recordings from an array of nine short-period passive seismometers located on Bench Glacier, Alaska (USA) (61.033 degrees N, 145.687 degrees W). We focus on the arrival-time and amplitude information of the dominant Rayleigh wave phase. Over a 46-hour period we detect thousands of events using a cross-correlation based event identification method. Travel-time inversion of a subset of events (7\% of the total) defines an active crevasse, propagating more than 200 meters in three hours. From the Rayleigh wave amplitudes, we estimate the amount of volumetric opening along the crevasse as well as an average bulk attenuation ((Q) over bar = 42) for the ice in this part of the glacier. With the remaining icequake signals we establish a diurnal periodicity in seismicity, indicating that surface run-off and subglacial water pressure changes likely control the triggering of these surface events. Furthermore, we find that these events are too weak (i.e., too noisy) to locate individually. However, stacking individual events increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the waveforms, implying that these periodic sources are effectively stationary during the recording period.},

	abstract = {Lateral downslope flow in snow during snowmelt and rain-on-snow (ROS) events is a well-known phenomenon, yet its relevance to water redistribution at hillslope and catchment scales is not well understood. We used dye tracers, geophysical methods, and hydrometric measurements to describe the snow properties that promote lateral flow, assess the relative velocities of lateral flow in snow and soil, and estimate volumes of downslope flow. Results demonstrate that rain and melt water can travel tens of metres downslope along layers within the snowpack or at the snowpack base within tens of hours. Lateral flow within the snowpack becomes less likely as the snowpack becomes saturated and stratigraphic boundaries are destroyed. Flow along the base can be prevalent in all snowpack conditions. The net result of lateral flow in snow can be the deposition of water on the soil surface in advanced downslope positions relative to its point of origin, or direct discharge to a stream. Although both melt and ROS events can redistribute water to downslope positions, ROS events produced the most significant volumes of downslope flow. Direct stream contributions through the snowpack during one ROS event produced up to 12\% of streamflow during the event. This can help explain rapid delivery of water to streams during ROS events, as well as anomalously high contributions of event water during snowmelt hydrographs. In catchments with a persistent snowpack, lateral redistribution of water within the snowpack should be considered a relevant moisture redistribution mechanism.

	abstract = {Snow microstructure plays an important role in the remote sensing of snow water equivalent (SWE) for both passive and active microwave radars. The accuracy of microwave SWE retrieval algorithms is sensitive to (usually unknown) changes in microstructure. These algorithms could be improved with high-resolution estimates of microstructural properties by using an advanced instrument such as the Snow Micro Penetrometer (SMP), which measures penetration force at the millimeter scale and is sensitive to microstructure. The SMP can also take full micromechanical measurements at much greater speed and resolution and without observer bias than a traditional snow pit. Previous studies have shown that the snowpack stratigraphy and grain type can be accurately classified with one SMP measurement using basic statistics and classification trees (CTs). For this study, we used basic statistical measures of the penetration force and micromechanical estimates from an SMP inversion algorithm to significantly improve the classification accuracy of grain type and layer discrimination. We applied random forest (RF) techniques to classify three snow grain types (new snow, rounds, and facets) from SMP measurements collected in Switzerland and Grand Mesa, Colorado. RFs performed up to 8\% better than single CTs, with overall misclassification errors between 17\% and 40\%. The coefficient of variation of the penetration force proved to be the most important variable, followed by variables that contain information about grain size like microscale strength and the number of ruptures.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive hydroclimatic data set is presented for the 2011 water year to improve understanding of hydrologic processes in the rain-snow transition zone. This type of data set is extremely rare in scientific literature because of the quality and quantity of soil depth, soil texture, soil moisture, and soil temperature data. Standard meteorological and snow cover data for the entire 2011 water year are included, which include several rain-on-snow (ROS) events. Surface soil textures and soil depths from 57 points are presented as well as soil texture profiles from 14 points. Meteorological data include continuous hourly shielded, un-shielded, and wind-corrected precipitation, wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative humidity, dew point temperature, and incoming solar and thermal radiation data. This data is often viewed as "forcing data", and is gap filled and serially complete. Sub-surface data included are hourly soil moisture data from multiple depths from seven soil profiles within the catchment, and soil temperatures from multiple depths from two soil profiles. Hydrologic response data include hourly stream discharge from the catchment outlet weir, continuous snow depths from one location, intermittent snow depths from 5 locations, and snow depth and density data from ten weekly snow surveys. Snow and hydrologic response data are meant to provide data on the catchment hydrologic response to the weather data. This data is mostly presented "as measured" although snow depths from one sensor and streamflow at the catchment outlet have been gap filled and are serially complete. Though the weather, snow, and hydrologic response data only covers one water year, the presentation of the additional subsurface data (soil depth, texture, moisture, and temperature) makes it one of the most detailed and complete hydro-climatic data sets from the climatically sensitive rain-snow transition zone. The data presented are appropriate for a wide range of modeling (energy balance snow modeling, soil capacitance parametric modeling, etc.) and descriptive studies.

@article{McCreight:2014aa,
	abstract = {Historically, observing snow depth over large areas has been difficult. When snow depth observations are sparse, regression models can be used to infer the snow depth over a given area. Data sparsity has also left many important questions about such inference unexamined. Improved inference, or estimation, of snow depth and its spatial distribution from a given set of observations can benefit a wide range of applications from water resource management, to ecological studies, to validation of satellite estimates of snow pack. The development of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has provided non-sparse snow depth measurements, which we use in this study, to address fundamental questions about snow depth inference using both sparse and non-sparse observations. For example, when are more data needed and when are data redundant? Results apply to both traditional and manual snow depth measurements and to LiDAR observations. Through sampling experiments on high-resolution LiDAR snow depth observations at six separate 1.17-km(2) sites in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, we provide novel perspectives on a variety of issues affecting the regression estimation of snow depth from sparse observations. We measure the effects of observation count, random selection of observations, quality of predictor variables, and cross-validation procedures using three skill metrics: percent error in total snow volume, root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-2. Extremes of predictor quality are used to understand the range of its effect; how do predictors downloaded from internet perform against more accurate predictors measured by LiDAR? Whereas cross validation remains the only option for validating inference from sparse observations, in our experiments, the full set of LiDAR-measured snow depths can be considered the true' spatial distribution and used to understand cross-validation bias at the spatial scale of inference. We model at the 30-m resolution of readily available predictors, which is a popular spatial resolution in the literature. Three regression models are also compared, and we briefly examine how sampling design affects model skill. Results quantify the primary dependence of each skill metric on observation count that ranges over three orders of magnitude, doubling at each step from 25 up to 3200. Whereas uncertainty (resulting from random selection of observations) in percent error of true total snow volume is typically well constrained by 100-200 observations, there is considerable uncertainty in the inferred spatial distribution (R-2) even at medium observation counts (200-800). We show that percent error in total snow volume is not sensitive to predictor quality, although RMSE and R-2 (measures of spatial distribution) often depend critically on it. Inaccuracies of downloaded predictors (most often the vegetation predictors) can easily require a quadrupling of observation count to match RMSE and R-2 scores obtained by LiDAR-measured predictors. Under cross validation, the RMSE and R-2 skill measures are consistently biased towards poorer results than their true validations. This is primarily a result of greater variance at the spatial scales of point observations used for cross validation than at the 30-m resolution of the model. The magnitude of this bias depends on individual site characteristics, observation count (for our experimental design), and sampling design.

Sampling designs that maximize independent information maximize cross-validation bias but also maximize true R-2. The bagging tree model is found to generally outperform the other regression models in the study on several criteria. Finally, we discuss and recommend use of LiDAR in conjunction with regression modelling to advance understanding of snow depth spatial distribution at spatial scales of thousands of square kilometres.

@article{Tinkham:2014aa,
	abstract = {There is increasing need to characterize the distribution of snow in complex terrain using remote sensing approaches, especially in isolated mountainous regions that are often water-limited, the principal source of terrestrial freshwater, and sensitive to climatic shifts and variations. We apply intensive topographic surveys, multi-temporal LiDAR, and Random Forest modeling to quantify snow volume and characterize associated errors across seven land cover types in a semi-arid mountainous catchment at a 1 and 4 m spatial resolution. The LiDAR-based estimates of both snow-off surface topology and snow depths were validated against ground-based measurements across the catchment. LiDAR-derived snow depths estimates were most accurate in areas of low lying vegetation such as meadow and shrub vegetation (RMSE = 0.14 m) as compared to areas consisting of tree cover (RMSE = 0.20-0.35 m). The highest errors were found along the edge of conifer forests (RMSE = 0.35 m), however a second conifer transect outside the catchment had much lower errors (RMSE = 0.21 m). This difference is attributed to the wind exposure of the first site that led to highly variable snow depths at short spatial distances. The Random Forest modeled errors deviated from the field measured errors with-a RMSE of 0.09-0.34 m across the different cover types. The modeling was used to calculate a theoretical lower and upper bound of catchment snow volume error of 21-30\%. Results show that snow drifts, which are important for maintaining spring and summer stream flows and establishing and sustaining water-limited plant species, contained 30 +/- 5-6\% of the snow volume while only occupying 10\% of the catchment area similar to findings by prior physically-based modeling approaches. This study demonstrates the potential utility of combining multi-temporal LiDAR with Random Forest modeling to quantify the distribution of snow depth with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

@article{Anderson:2014aa,
	abstract = {This study investigates causes behind correlations between snow and terrain properties in a 27 km(2) mountain watershed. Whereas terrain correlations reveal where snow resides, the physical processes responsible for correlations can be ambiguous. We conducted biweekly snow surveys at small transect scales to provide insight into late-season correlations at the basin scale. The evolving parameters of transect variograms reveal the interplay between differential accumulation and differential ablation that is responsible for correlations between snow and terrain properties including elevation, aspect, and canopy density. Elevation-induced differential accumulation imposes a persistent source of varariabity at the basin scale, but is not sufficient to explain the elevational distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) on the ground. Differential ablation, with earlier and more frequent ablation at lower elevations, steepens the SWE-elevation gradient through the season. Correlations with aspect are primarily controlled by differences in solar loading. Aspect related redistribution of precipitation by wind, however, is important early in the season. Forested sites hold more snow than nonforested sites at the basin scale due to differences in ablation processes, while open areas within forested sites hold more snow than covered areas due to interception. However, as the season progresses energetic differences between open and covered areas within forested sites cause differences induced by interception to diminish. Results of this study can help determine which accumulation and ablation processes must be represented explicitly and which can be parameterized in models of snow dynamics.},

	abstract = {On 19 January 2012, a large D3 avalanche (approximately 10(3) t) was recorded with an infrasound array ideally situated for observing the avalanche velocity. The avalanche crossed Highway 21 in Central Idaho during the largest avalanche cycle in the 15 years of recorded history and deposited approximately 8 m of snow on the roadway. Possible source locations along the avalanche path were estimated at 0.5 s intervals and were used to calculate the avalanche velocity during the 64 s event. Approximately 10 s prior to the main avalanche signal, a small infrasound signal originated from the direction of the start zone. We infer this to be the initial snow pack failure, a precursory signal to the impending avalanche. The avalanche accelerated to a maximum velocity of 35.9 7.6m s(-1) within 30 s before impacting the highway.

@article{Walters:2014aa,
	abstract = {Accurate characterization of snow-covered area (SCA) and snow water equivalent (SWE) in complex terrain is needed to improve estimation of streamflow timing and volume, and is important for land surface modeling. Direct field observations of SWE, SCA and atmospheric forcing inputs for models of snow accumulation and ablation are typically sparsely sampled in space. Satellite imagery is, therefore, a critical tool for verification and confirmation of snow model estimates of SCA. The Landsat system provides snow-covered area estimates at a spatial resolution of 30 m with a 16-day return interval, while daily estimates of SCA and fractional SCA (f(SCA)) are available at 500 m from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This study describes and tests a linear model to downscale MODIS MOD10A1 f(SCA) (500 m) data to higher-resolution (30 m) spatially explicit binary SCA estimates. The algorithm operates on the assumption that two variables, potential insolation and elevation, control differential ablation of snow cover throughout spring melt at 30 m to 500 m scales. The model downscales daily 500 f(SCA) estimates from MODIS to provide daily SCA estimates at a spatial resolution of 30 m, using limited Landsat SCA for calibration and independent Landsat SCA estimates for validation. Downscaled SCA estimates demonstrate statistically significant improvement from randomly generated model ensembles, indicating that insolation and elevation are dominant factors controlling the snow cover distribution in the semi-arid, mountainous region in southwestern Idaho, USA where this study is performed. Validation is performed with Landsat data not used for calibration, and is also performed using Landsat 500 m aggregate f(SCA) instead of MODIS f(SCA) as an ideal case. Downscaled estimates show reasonable accuracy (test metric outperforms random ensembles at p = 0.01 significance level for multiple ranges of snow cover) with only one calibrated parameter.

	abstract = {The timing, magnitude, and spatial distribution of snow cover and the resulting surface water inputs (SWI) are simulated at a small catchment located in the rain-snow transition zone of southwest Idaho, USA. A physically based snow model is run on this 1.5 ha study catchment, which has an elevation range of 1600-1645 masl. The catchment is divided into relatively steep (mean slope angle of 21 degrees) northeast and southwest facing hill slopes by an ephemeral stream that drains to the southeast. SWI are fundamental controls on soil moisture, streamflow generation, groundwater recharge, and nutrient cycling. Although the timing of melt events is similar across the basin, southwest facing slopes receive smaller magnitude and more frequent SWI from mid winter snow melt, while the northeast facing slope receives greater SWI during the spring. Three spatial patterns are observed in the modeled SWI time series: (1) equal between slopes, (2) majority of SWI on southwest facing slopes, and (3) majority of SWI on northeast facing slopes. Although any of these three spatial patterns can occur during the snow season, four emergent SWI patterns emerge through the melt season: (1) near uniform, (2) controlled by topographic differences in energy fluxes, (3) transitional, and (4) controlled by snow distribution. Rain on snow (ROS) events produce similar SWI between the northeast and southwest facing slopes, with the difference being attributed primarily to snow distribution. Turbulent fluxes dominate the snowpack energetics in four of the five rain on snow events, and advective fluxes from precipitation are greater than 17\% during the 2 rain on snow events in December and January. Net radiation fluxes dominate spring melt events. Variations in the method used to distribute precipitation may result in large differences in total precipitation to the basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Repeated light detection and ranging (lidar) surveys are quickly becoming the de facto method for measuring spatial variability of montane snowpacks at high resolution. This study examines the potential of a 750 km(2) lidar-derived data set of snow depths, collected during the 2007 northern Colorado Cold Lands Processes Experiment (CLPX-2), as a validation source for an operational hydrologic snow model. The SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) model framework, operated by the US National Weather Service, combines a physically based energy-and-mass-balance snow model with satellite, airborne and automated ground-based observations to provide daily estimates of snowpack properties at nominally 1 km resolution over the conterminous United States. Independent validation data are scarce due to the assimilating nature of SNODAS, compelling the need for an independent validation data set with substantial geographic coverage.

Within 12 distinctive 500 x 500m study areas located throughout the survey swath, ground crews performed approximately 600 manual snow depth measurements during each of the CLPX-2 lidar acquisitions. This supplied a data set for constraining the uncertainty of upscaled lidar estimates of snow depth at the 1 km SNODAS resolution, resulting in a root-mean-square difference of 13 cm. Upscaled lidar snow depths were then compared to the SNODAS estimates over the entire study area for the dates of the lidar flights. The remotely sensed snow depths provided a more spatially continuous comparison data set and agreed more closely to the model estimates than that of the in situ measurements alone. Finally, the results revealed three distinct areas where the differences between lidar observations and SNODAS estimates were most drastic, providing insight into the causal influences of natural processes on model uncertainty.},

We estimate the a daily time series of bedrock infiltration in a small catchment in the rain snow transition zone in southwest Idaho, using the difference between measured stream discharge and modeled soil drainage. The accuracy of spatial patterns in soil water storage are optimized, rather than the more common approach of minimizing error in integrated quantities such as streamflow. Bedrock infiltration is estimated to be 289 mm 50 mm for the 2011 water year, which is 34\% +/- 12\% of the precipitation (95\% confidence).

	abstract = {Evaluating and improving snow models and outflow predictions for hydrological applications is hindered by the lack of continuous data on bulk volumetric liquid water content (theta(w)) and storage capacity of the melting snowpack. The combination of upward looking ground-penetrating radar and conventional snow height sensors enable continuous, nondestructive determinations of theta(w) in natural snow covers from first surficial wetting until shortly before melt out. We analyze diurnal and seasonal cycles of theta(w) for 4years in a flat study site and for three melt seasons on slopes and evaluate model simulations for two different water transport schemes in the snow cover model SNOWPACK. Observed maximum increases in theta(w) during a day are below 1.7vol\% (90th percentile) at the flat site. Concerning seasonal characteristics of theta(w), less than 10\% of recorded data exceed 5 vol\% at the flat site and 3.5vol\% at slopes. Both water transport schemes in SNOWPACK underestimate maximum theta(w) at the flat site systematically for all observed melt seasons, while simulated theta(w) maxima on slopes are accurate. Implementing observed changes in theta(w) per day in outflow predictions increases model performance toward higher agreement with lysimeter measurements. Hence, continuously monitoring theta(w) improves our understanding of liquid water percolation and retention in snow, which is highly relevant for several aspects of the cryosphere such as avalanche formation, catchment hydrology, and ice sheet mass balances.},

	abstract = {The thermal conductivity of snow determines, to a large extent, ground heat flux and snow metamorphism. One common method of measuring the thermal conductivity of snow is with a needle probe. We measured the microstructural changes in the snow around a typical needle using micro-computed tomography. The insertion of the needle probe caused structural changes up to a radial distance of 0.5-1 mm. Using a commercial needle probe with short (30 s) heating time, we measured thermal conductivity values in snow that were 50\% lower than the conductivity measured using a calibrated guarded hot-plate apparatus. Numerically simulated time temperature curves with an introduced air gap that simulated the needle damage reproduced the observed needle-probe results well, confirming that poor contact resistance between the needle and the snow will lead to measurement discrepancies and a large bias. While most measurements in snow have been done using a long heating time and are not subject to this error, the thermal conductivity of snow measured with needle probes with short measurement times should be avoided. This same effect is probably observed in other brittle and highly porous materials, a condition that may not be widely appreciated.},

	abstract = {The physical properties of snow are tied to its microstructure. Especially for the slow, plastic deformation of snow and firn, the crystal orientation is an important factor in addition to the geometry of the ice matrix. While micro-computed tomography measures the snow microstructure precisely, it gives no information about the orientation of the ice crystals. In this study, we applied a temperature gradient of 50 K m(-1) to large blocks of undisturbed decomposed snow and sieved snow during 3 months. The mean temperature of the snow samples during the temperature gradient experiment was -20 degrees C. Two closely spaced snow samples were taken before the experiment, then every week during the first month and afterwards every month. From each sampling, one sample was analyzed by micro-computed tomography and the other was used for thin sections. The orientation of the c-axis was measured in the thin sections using an automatic ice texture analyzer. Initial density was 30\% higher in the sieved snow sample. Density and specific surface area evolved alike, while the fabric showed a different evolution between the two samples. The undisturbed snow evolved from a weak single-maximum fabric towards a weak girdle fabric, while the sieved sample showed no evolution. The undisturbed snow sample converged toward the sieved sample fabric after 6 weeks, but continued its evolution thereafter. We suggest that the main factor causing this different behavior is the difference in density and in pore size.},

	abstract = {Finding relevant microstructural parameters beyond density is a longstanding problem which hinders the formulation of accurate parameterizations of physical properties of snow. Towards a remedy, we address the effective thermal conductivity tensor of snow via anisotropic, second-order bounds. The bound provides an explicit expression for the thermal conductivity and predicts the relevance of a microstructural anisotropy parameter Q, which is given by an integral over the two-point correlation function and unambiguously defined for arbitrary snow structures. For validation we compiled a comprehensive data set of 167 snow samples. The set comprises individual samples of various snow types and entire time series of metamorphism experiments under isothermal and temperature gradient conditions. All samples were digitally reconstructed by micro-computed tomography to perform microstructure-based simulations of heat transport. The incorporation of anisotropy via Q considerably reduces the root mean square error over the usual density-based parameterization. The systematic quantification of anisotropy via the two-point correlation function suggests a generalizable route to incorporate microstructure into snowpack models. We indicate the inter-relation of the conductivity to other properties and outline a potential impact of Q on dielectric constant, permeability and adsorption rate of diffusing species in the pore space.},

	abstract = {We used three-dimensional (3-D) images of snow microstructure to carry out numerical estimations of the full tensor of the intrinsic permeability of snow (K). This study was performed on 35 snow samples, spanning a wide range of seasonal snow types. For several snow samples, a significant anisotropy of permeability was detected and is consistent with that observed for the effective thermal conductivity obtained from the same samples. The anisotropy coefficient, defined as the ratio of the vertical over the horizontal components of K, ranges from 0.74 for a sample of decomposing precipitation particles collected in the field to 1.66 for a depth hoar specimen. Because the permeability is related to a characteristic length, we introduced a dimensionless tensor K* = K/r(es)(2), where the equivalent sphere radius of ice grains (r(es)) is computed from the specific surface area of snow (SSA) and the ice density (rho(i)) as follows: r(es) = 3/(SSA x rho(i)). We define K and K* as the average of the diagonal components of K and K*, respectively. The 35 values of K* were fitted to snow density (rho(s)) and provide the following regression: K = (3.0 +/- 0.3) r(es)(2) exp((-0.0130 +/- 0.0003) rho(s)). We noted that the anisotropy of permeability does not affect significantly the proposed equation. This regression curve was applied to several independent datasets from the literature and compared to other existing regression curves or analytical models. The results show that it is probably the best currently available simple relationship linking the average value of permeability, K, to snow density and specific surface area.},

	abstract = {We carried out numerical simulations of the conductivity of snow using microtomographic images. The full tensor of the effective thermal conductivity (k(eff)) was computed from 30 three-dimensional images of the snow microstructure, spanning all types of seasonal snow. Only conduction through ice and interstitial air were considered. The obtained values are strongly correlated to snow density. The main cause for the slight scatter around the regression curve to snow density is the anisotropy of k(eff): the vertical component of k(eff) of facetted crystals and depth hoar samples is up to 1.5 times larger than the horizontal component, while rounded grains sampled deeply in the snowpack exhibit the inverse behavior. Results of simulations neglecting the conduction in the interstitial air indicate that this phase plays a vital role in heat conduction through snow. The computed effective thermal conductivity is found to increase with decreasing temperature, mostly following the temperature dependency of the thermal conductivity of ice. The results are compared to experimental data obtained either with the needle-probe technique or using combined measurements of the vertical heat flux and the corresponding temperature gradient. Needle-probe measurements are systematically significantly lower than those from the two other techniques. The observed discrepancies between the three methods are investigated and briefly discussed.

	abstract = {We have investigated the isothermal densification of new snow under an external mechanical stress. New snow samples that mimic natural snow were made in the laboratory by sieving ice crystals grown in a snowmaker. This allowed us to assemble homogeneous initial samples with reproducible values of low density and high specific surface area (SSA). Laboratory creep experiments were conducted in an X-ray microtomograph at -20 degrees C for 2 days. We focused on the evolution of density and SSA as a function of constant stress at a single temperature. External mechanical stresses resembled natural overburden stresses of a snow sample at depths of similar to 0-30 cm of new snow. We demonstrate that densification increases with higher external stress and lower initial densities. We find that the evolution of the SSA is independent of the density and follows a unique decay for all measurements of the present type of new snow. The results suggest that details of the SSA decrease can be investigated using carefully designed experiments of short duration which are convenient to conduct. Additionally, we calculated the strain evolution and identify transient creep behavior that does not follow the Andrade creep law of denser snow or polycrystalline ice.},

	abstract = {Chemical and physical processes, such as heterogeneous chemical reactions, light scattering, and metamorphism occur in the natural snowpack. To model these processes in the snowpack, the specific surface area (SSA) is a key parameter. In this study, two methods, computed tomography and methane adsorption, which have intrinsically different effective resolutions-molecular and 30 mu m, respectively-were used to determine the SSA of similar natural snow samples. Except for very fresh snow, the two methods give identical results, with an uncertainty of 3\%. This implies that the surface of aged natural snow is smooth up to a scale of about 30 mu m and that if smaller structures are present they do not contribute significantly to the overall SSA. It furthermore implies that for optical methods a voxel size of 10 mu m is sufficient to capture all structural features of this type of snow; however, fresh precipitation appears to contain small features that cause an under-estimation of SSA with tomography at this resolution. The methane adsorption method is therefore superior to computed tomography for very fresh snow having high SSA. Nonetheless, in addition to SSA determination, tomography provides full geometric information about the ice matrix. It can also be advantageously used to investigate layered snow packs, as it allows measuring SSA in layers of less than 1 mm.},

	abstract = {To study the recrystallization processes during temperature gradient metamorphism of snow, we developed a sample holder that allows applying well-defined and stable thermal gradients to a snow sample while it is scanned in an x-ray micro-tomograph. To this end, both the thermal insulation of the sample as well as image contrast and resolution of the tomography had to be optimized. We solved this conflict by using thin aluminum cylinders in combination with highly insulating foam. This design is light, does not corrupt image quality and provides very good thermal decoupling from the environment. The sample holder was instrumented to measure the effective conductivity of the snow sample and calibrated using five materials of known conductivity. Finite element simulations were consistent with the calibration measurements and gave insight into the internal temperature and heat flux fields. With this setup, geometric and thermal evolution of snow under realistic thermal boundary conditions like alternating temperature gradients can be measured.},

	abstract = {The composition of the lower atmospheric boundary layer can be strongly influenced by snow photochemistry. Surface snow, where air-snow interactions take place, is viewed as slowly changing quasi-isothermal snow, implied by the observation of mainly rounded snow crystals. The role of snow for photochemistry is therefore expected to be purely geometric. However, large temperature gradients are often observed in these layers, which would imply high recrystallization and faceting. In controlled laboratory experiments we showed that temperature gradients on the order of 100 K m(-1) do not lead necessarily to faceting if their sign changes with a daily cycle. The shape of snow crystals does not reflect necessarily the metamorphic process. With time-lapse X-ray tomography, recrystallization rates as high as 60\% of the total ice mass were observed during 12 hours. The high recrystallization rates in apparently isothermal snow not only contradict the current understanding of snow metamorphism, they also might influence chemical air-snow interactions.

	abstract = {Snow hides its true structure from easy visual observation. One reason is that ice is transparent, so the three-dimensional (3-D) structure is impossible to disentangle. 3-D reconstruction is essential to understand the physical and mechanical properties of snow. In recent years, the techniques to measure and visualize snow in 3-D have improved tremendously. X-ray microtomography is much more user-friendly than the older microtome sectioning techniques. We show different techniques to measure cast and natural snow samples and the steps necessary to produce high-quality data. The simplest way is 3-D renderings. Imaging snow in 3-D definitively challenges our previous view of a snowpack consisting of particles as traditionally seen on a crystal card.},

	abstract = {Dry snow metamorphism under an external temperature gradient is the most common type of recrystallization of snow on the ground. The changes in snow microstructure modify the physical properties of snow, and therefore an understanding of this process is essential for many disciplines, from modeling the effects of snow on climate to assessing avalanche risk. We directly imaged the microstructural changes in snow during temperature gradient metamorphism (TGM) under a constant gradient of 50 K m(-1), using in situ time-lapse X-ray micro-tomography. This novel and non-destructive technique directly reveals the amount of ice that sublimates and is deposited during metamorphism, in addition to the exact locations of these phase changes. We calculated the average time that an ice volume stayed in place before it sublimated and found a characteristic residence time of 2-3 days. This means that most of the ice changes its phase from solid to vapor and back many times in a seasonal snowpack where similar temperature conditions can be found. Consistent with such a short timescale, we observed a mass turnover of up to 60\% of the total ice mass per day. The concept of hand-to-hand transport for the water vapor flux describes the observed changes very well. However, we did not find evidence for a macroscopic vapor diffusion enhancement. The picture of temperature gradient metamorphism produced by directly observing the changing microstructure sheds light on the micro-physical processes and could help to improve models that predict the physical properties of snow.},

@article{Kulessa&al:2012,
	abstract = {We have developed a new theory and numerical model of electrical self-potential (SP) signals associated with unsaturated flow in melting snow. The model is applicable to continuous natural melt as well as transient flow phenomena such as meltwater pulses and is tested using laboratory column experiments. SP signals fundamentally depend on the temporal evolution of snow porosity and meltwater flux, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH. We infer a reversal of the sign of the zeta potential (a fundamental electrical property of grain surfaces in porous media) consistent with well-known elution sequences of ions that cause progressive increases and decreases in meltwater pH and EC, respectively. Injection of fully melted snow samples, containing the entire natural range of ions, into melting snow columns caused additional temporary reversals of the sign of the zeta potential. Widely used empirical relationships between effective saturation, meltwater fraction, EC, and pH, as well as snow porosity, grain size, and permeability, are found to be robust for modeling purposes. Thus nonintrusive SP measurements can serve as proxies for snow meltwater fluxes and the temporal evolution of fundamental snow textural, hydraulic, or water quality parameters. Adaptation of automated multisensor SP acquisition technology from other environmental applications thus promises to bridge the widely acknowledged gap in spatial scales between satellite remote sensing and point measurements of snow properties. SP measurements and modeling may therefore contribute to solving a wide range of problems related to the assessment of water resource availability, avalanche or flood risk, or the amplification of climatic forcing of ice shelf, ice sheet, or glacier dynamics.},

	abstract = {Risk assessment of snow avalanches is mostly related to weather conditions and snow cover. However, a robust risk validation requires avalanche activity data, in order to compare predictions to actual events. For this purpose in December 2009 we installed a temporary 4-element, small aperture (150 m), infrasound array in the northwestern Italian Alps. The array was installed south of Mt. Rosa, at an elevation of 2000 m a.s.l. in the valley of Gressoney, Italy, where natural avalanches are expected and avalanche control by explosives is regularly performed. A multi-channel correlation analysis is carried out on the continuous infrasound data set recorded by the array as a function of apparent velocity, back-azimuth and frequency of recorded infrasound. This allowed detection of infrasonic signals propagating across the array from the background noise. During the 5-month-long experiment, 343 infrasonic events have been detected and characterized. These include sharp infrasonic transients (99 events) produced by explosions during avalanche control as well as longer lasting signals (244 events) possibly caused by avalanches. Although only few of these events were validated by direct avalanche observation, obtained results are promising and encouraging application of infrasound for long-term avalanche observation on wide areas, as the peak in avalanche activity in winter 2009-2010 was observed shortly after the infrasound events peaked as well.

@article{Eiriksson&al:2013,
	abstract = {Lateral downslope flow in snow during snowmelt and rain-on-snow (ROS) events is a well-known phenomenon, yet its relevance to water redistribution at hillslope and catchment scales is not well understood. We used dye tracers, geophysical methods, and hydrometric measurements to describe the snow properties that promote lateral flow, assess the relative velocities of lateral flow in snow and soil, and estimate volumes of downslope flow. Results demonstrate that rain and melt water can travel tens of metres downslope along layers within the snowpack or at the snowpack base within tens of hours. Lateral flow within the snowpack becomes less likely as the snowpack becomes saturated and stratigraphic boundaries are destroyed. Flow along the base can be prevalent in all snowpack conditions. The net result of lateral flow in snow can be the deposition of water on the soil surface in advanced downslope positions relative to its point of origin, or direct discharge to a stream. Although both melt and ROS events can redistribute water to downslope positions, ROS events produced the most significant volumes of downslope flow. Direct stream contributions through the snowpack during one ROS event produced up to 12\% of streamflow during the event. This can help explain rapid delivery of water to streams during ROS events, as well as anomalously high contributions of event water during snowmelt hydrographs. In catchments with a persistent snowpack, lateral redistribution of water within the snowpack should be considered a relevant moisture redistribution mechanism.

	abstract = {Snow slab avalanches are believed to begin by the gravity- driven shear failure of weak layers in stratified snow. The critical crack length for shear crack propagation along such layers should increase without bound as the slope decreases. However, recent experiments show that the critical length of artificially introduced cracks remains constant or, if anything, slightly decreases with decreasing slope. This surprising observation can be understood in terms of volumetric collapse of the weak layer during failure, resulting in the formation and propagation of mixed- mode anticracks, which are driven simultaneously by slope- parallel and slope- normal components of gravity. Such fractures may propagate even if crack- face friction impedes downhill sliding of the snowpack, indicating a scenario in which two separate conditions have to be met for slab avalanche release.},

	abstract = {Fine-grained, dry snow with a density range of 190-435 kg m(-3) was tested in triaxial compression at -12degreesC with confining pressures varying between 0 and 40 kPa. The tests were strain-rate controlled, with strain rates ranging between 7.4 x 10(-7) s(-1) and 6.6 x 10(-5) s(-1). The analysis of the test results revealed that the relationship between yield stress and viscous strain rate is best given by a power law, similar to polycrystalline ice. However, the power-law exponent n is a function of density and varies between 1.8 (low-density snow, rho < 200 kg m(-3)) and 3.6 (high-density snow, rho > 320 kg m(-3)). The tests also showed that lower-density snow displays a significant non-linear stress-strain response before yielding. Two further aspects of the constitutive behaviour of snow were identified: (1) the strain-rate independence of the post-yield work-hardening behaviour in compression and (2) the independence of the axial yield stress in relation to the confining pressure. The experimental observations are discussed with respect to the mechanical properties of polycrystalline ice, which is the constituent material of the load-bearing ice skeleton.},

	abstract = {A deformation-controlled triaxial apparatus has been developed in order to investigate the mechanical behaviour of alpine snow Cylindrical specimens (58 mm in diameter, 126 mm in height) can be axially deformed by applying tensile or compressive strain rates between 2.4 x 10(-7) s(-1) and 2.4 x 10(-2) s(-1). Compressed air is used to laterally load the snow specimens with pressures of up to 40 kPa. The volumetric deformation is found by carefully encapsulating the snow samples in an airtight Mylar foil and measuring the expelled pore air during sample deformation. The multidimensional stress-strain behaviour can therefore be determined, and constitutive theories of snow advanced. The device is located in the cold rooms of the Weissfluhjoch research station of the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research. Some 180 tests have been performed over the last four winters. The density of the snow specimens varied between 190 and 435 kg m(-3). Part I of this two-part paper discusses the development of the apparatus and the applied testing methodology. Qualitative results are provided. In Part 11, a detailed analysis of the results is presented and the viscoelastic properties of snow quantified.},

@article{Schneebeli&al:2004,
	abstract = {Temperature gradient metamorphism is one of the dominant processes changing the structure of natural dry snow. The structure of snow regulates the thermal and mechanical properties. Physical models and numerical simulations of the evolution of the snow cover require a thorough understanding of the interplay between structure and physical properties. The structure of snow and the heat conductivity were measured simultaneously without disturbance in a miniature snow breeder. The structure was measured by microtomography, and heat conductivity by measuring heat fluxes and temperatures. A temperature gradient from 25 to 100 K m(-1) was applied to the snow. The snow density range of the samples varied from 150 to 500 kg m(-3). The density in the observed volume remained constant during the experiments under temperature gradient conditions. The structure was analysed with respect to the size of typical ice structures and air pores, specific surface area, curvature and anisotropy of the ice matrix. The temporal changes in structure and heat conductivity are compared. The heat conductivity changed by as much as twice its initial value, caused by changes in structure and texture, but not due to changes in density. This shows the enormous importance of structure in the evolution of the heat conductivity. The observed changes are not in good agreement with the current understanding of the metamorphic process, because beat conductivity increased during temperature gradient metamorphism, instead of the expected decrease due to a shrinking of the bonds. We also observed a plateau in the evolution of the heat conductivity coefficient, which indicates a quasi-steady state of the structural evolution with respect to thermophysical proper-ties of snow.

	abstract = {Stability prediction from SnowMicroPen (SMP) profiles would support avalanche forecasting operations, since objective stability information could be gathered more quickly than with standard tests, thereby allowing sampling at higher resolution and over larger spatial scales. Previous studies have related the snow properties derived from the SMP to observed snow properties at Rutschblock (RB) and compression test failure planes. The goals of this study are to show to what extent snowpack stability for artificial triggering, based on RB. can be derived from SMP measurements and how multiple measurements at the RB scale improve the results. Measurements at 36 different sites were used for the development of a classification scheme. Each site included a RB test, a manual profile, and 6 to 10 adjacent SMP measurements, for a total of 262 SMP profiles. A recently improved SMP theory was applied to estimate the micro-structural and mechanical properties of manually defined weak layers and slab layers. SMP signal quality control and different noise treatment methods were taken into consideration in the analysis. The best and most robust predictor of RB stability was the weak layer micro-scale strength. In combination with the SMP-estimated mean density of the slab layer, the total accuracy of predicting RB stability classes was 85\% over the entire dataset, and 88\% when signals with obvious signal dampening (11\% of the dataset) were removed. The total accuracy increased when multiple SMP measurements at the RB scale were used to calculate the mean weak layer strength, when compared to using just one SMP measurement at a site. The analysis was robust to trends and offsets in the absolute SMP force, which was a frequent signal error. However, it was sensitive to dampened or disturbed SMP force micro variance. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the best predictor of instability. the weak layer micro-scale strength, was robust to the choice of SMP signal noise removal method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Information on snow-cover stability is important for predicting avalanche danger. Traditionally, stability evaluation is based on manual observations of snow stratigraphy and stability tests, which are time-consuming. The SnowMicroPen (SMP) is a high-resolution, constant-speed penetrometer to measure penetration resistance. We have analysed the resistance signal to derive snow stability. The proposed stability algorithm was developed by comparing 68 SMP force-distance profiles with the corresponding manual profiles, including stability tests. The algorithm identifies a set of four potentially weak layers by taking into account changes in structure and rupture strength of microstructural elements that make up snow layers as derived from the SMP signal. In 90\% of the cases, one of the four potentially weak layers proposed by the algorithm coincided with the failure layer observed in the stability test. To select the critical layer from the four potential weaknesses was more difficult. With fully automatic picking of the critical layer, agreement with the failure layer observed in the stability test was reached in 60\% of the cases. To derive a stability classification, we analysed weak-layer as well as slab properties. These predictor variables allow the SNIP signal to be classified into two stability classes, poor and fair-to-good, with an accuracy of similar to 75\% when compared with observed stability. The SMP, in combination with the proposed algorithm, shows high potential for providing snow-cover stability information at high resolution in time and space.},

	abstract = {In non-forested mountain regions, wind plays a dominant role in determining snow accumulation and melt patterns. A new, computationally efficient algorithm for distributing the complex and heterogeneous effects of wind on snow distributions was developed. The distribution algorithm uses terrain structure, vegetation, and wind data to adjust commonly available precipitation data to simulate wind-affected accumulations. This research describes model development and application in three research catchments in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in southwest Idaho, USA. All three catchments feature highly variable snow distributions driven by wind. The algorithm was used to derive model forcings for Isnobal, a mass and energy balance distributed snow model. Development and initial testing took place in the Reynolds Mountain East catchment (0.36 km(2)) where R-2 values for the wind-affected snow distributions ranged from 0.50 to 0.67 for four observation periods spanning two years. At the Upper Sheep Creek catchment (0.26 km(2)) R-2 values for the wind-affected model were 0.66 and 0.70. These R-2 values matched or exceeded previously published cross-validation results from regression-based statistical analyses of snow distributions in similar environments. In both catchments the wind-affected model accurately located large drift zones, snow-scoured slopes, and produced melt patterns consistent with observed streamflow. Models that did not account for wind effects produced relatively homogenous SWE distributions, R-2 values approaching 0.0, and melt patterns inconsistent with observed streamflow. The Dobson Creek (14.0 km(2)) application incorporated elevation effects into the distribution routine and was conducted over a two-dimensional grid of 6.67 x 10(5) pixels. Comparisons with satellite-derived snow-covered-area again demonstrated that the model did an excellent job locating regions with wind-affected snow accumulations. This final application demonstrated that the computational efficiency and modest data requirements of this approach are ideally suited for large-scale operational applications.

	abstract = {Determining surface precipitation phase is required to properly correct precipitation gage data for wind effects, to determine the hydrologic response to a precipitation event, and for hydrologic modeling when rain will be treated differently from snow. In this paper we present a comparison of several methods for determining precipitation phase using 12 years of hourly precipitation, weather and snow data from a long-term measurement site at Reynolds Mountain East (RME), a headwater catchment within the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW), in the Owyhee Mountains of Idaho, USA. Methods are based on thresholds of (1) air temperature (T-a) at 0 degrees C, (2) dual T-a threshold, 1 to 3 degrees C, (3) dewpoint temperature (T-d) at 0 degrees C, and (4) wet bulb temperature (T-w) at 0 degrees C. The comparison shows that at the RME Grove site, the dual threshold approach predicts too much snow, while T-a, T-d and T-w are generally similar predicting equivalent snow volumes over the 12 year-period indicating that during storms the cloud level is at or close to the surface at this location. To scale up the evaluation of these methods we evaluate them across a 380 m elevation range in RCEW during a large mixed-phase storm event. The event began as snow at all elevations and over the course of 4 h transitioned to rain at the lowest through highest elevations. Using 15-minute measurements of precipitation, changes in snow depth (z(s)), T-a, T-d and T-w, at seven sites through this elevation range, we found precipitation phase linked to the during-storm surface humidity. By measuring humidity along an elevation gradient during the storm we are able to track changes in T-d to reliably estimate precipitation phase and effectively track the elevation of the rain/snow transition during the event.

	abstract = {Two commonly used strategies in modeling snowmelt are the energy balance and temperature-index methods. Here we evaluate the distributed hydrologic impacts of these two different snowmelt modeling strategies, each in conjunction with a physics-based hydrologic model (PIHM). Results illustrate that both the Isnobal energy-balance and calibrated temperature-index methods adequately reproduce snow depletion at the observation site. However, the models exhibit marked differences in the distribution of snowmelt. When combined with PIHM, both models capture streamflow reasonably during calibration year (WY06), but Isnobal model gives better streamflow results in the validation year (WY07). The uncalibrated temperature-index model predicts streamflow poorly in both years. Differences between distributed snowmelt, as predicted by Isnobal and calibrated temperature-index method, and its consequent effect on predicted hydrologic states suggest the need to carefully calibrate temperature-index models in both time and space. Combined physics-based snow and hydrologic models provide the best accuracy, while a temperature-index model using coefficients from the literature the poorest. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Observed changes in midelevation snow cover and duration have raised concerns over future impacts of global warming on snowmelt-dependent water resources and ecosystems. However, predictions of future changes in snow hydrology and water supply from mountain basins are complicated by natural variability in climate and interactions among topography, vegetation structure, wind and radiation energy, and snow deposition. In this study, interannual variability in snow-cover development, snow melt, and runoff is assessed for a range of precipitation and temperature conditions typical of a mountain catchment, the Reynolds Mountain East (RME) basin, in Idaho. A spatially distributed energy and mass balance snow model, Isnobal, coupled with a windfield and snow redistribution model, is used to continuously simulate snow accumulation and melt for five individual snow seasons (1984, 1986, 1987, 2001, and 2006), representing the historic range of climatic variance. The modeling results compare well with the field measurements of snow water equivalent for all simulation snow seasons (Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0.81 to 0.97). The modeling scheme used in this study demonstrates spatial and temporal differences in snow-cover development and melt processes in complex mountain terrain. During all simulation snow seasons, the forested site was shown to hold more snow, generate more snowmelt, and melt later than the exposed site of the basin. Comparison of simulation results for wet and dry snow seasons showed that the snow melts earlier and a greater fraction of surface water input (SWI) is utilized to fill soil water storage during dry seasons than in wet snow seasons. This study demonstrates differences in snowmelt volume and timing during wet and dry seasons within a mountain basin. It will improve understanding of how interannual variability affects the delivery of water from the seasonal snowcover to the soil and streams of mountain basins, and can provide useful inputs to the decision-making process for reservoir and water management strategies for utilizing surplus or supplementing deficit water supplies during wet and dry years, respectively.

	abstract = {Snow is an important natural reservoir that holds water on the landscape for release later in the season in western North America and other portions of the world. As air temperature increases with global climate change, the character of the generally established seasonal snowcover will be affected. To study the specific response to variable climate, a carefully collected and processed meteorological data set for the 1984-2008 water years (WYs) was assembled for a snow-dominated headwater mountain catchment. The data were used to force a physically based, distributed energy balance snow model to simulate patterns of snow deposition and melt over the catchment for the 25-year period. This period covers both the highest (1984) and lowest (1992) snow seasons on record and exhibits extreme inter-annual variability. This unique forcing data set captured meteorological conditions that resulted in the range of variability in snowcover accumulation, timing of ablation, and the timing and amount of surface water input (SWI), and discharge during the 25-year study period. SWI is the amount of liquid water delivered to the soil surface from melting snow or from rain that passes through the snowcover or falls directly on the soil. Warm winters, characterized by early-and mid-winter rain, triggered earlier inputs from SWI and response in discharge than cool winters. Cool conditions prolonged the generation of SWI and streamflow out of the basin. Very wet conditions that were warm passed 50\% of the SWI 27 days earlier and passed 50\% of the discharge 15 days earlier, when compared to very wet conditions that were cool. Warmer conditions produced less snow water equivalent, shortened the melt season, and would be expected to extend the summer drought. Copyright. (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Long-term water balance investigations are needed to better understand hydrologic systems, especially semi-arid mountainous catchments. These systems exhibit considerable interannual variability in precipitation as well as spatial variation in snow accumulation, soils, and vegetation. This study extended a previous 10-year water balance based on measurements and model simulations to 24 years for the Upper Sheep Creek (USC) catchment, a 26 ha, snow-fed, semi-arid rangeland headwater drainage within the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in southwestern Idaho, USA. Additional analyses afforded by the additional years of data demonstrated that the variability between streamflow and annual precipitation (r(2) = 0.54) could be explained by the timing of precipitation and antecedent moisture conditions. Winter-spring precipitation and soil moisture deficit at the beginning of the water year accounted for 83\% of the variability in streamflow, which was almost as accurate as applying the more complex physically-based Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) numerical model (r(2) = 0.85) over the three dominant land cover classes. A conceptual model was formulated based on field observations, numerical simulations and previous studies. Winter precipitation and spring snowmelt must first replenish the deficit within the soil water profile and ground water system before water is delivered to the stream. During this period, surface water and ground water are tightly coupled and their interaction is critical to streamflow generation. Shortly after snow ablation, however, water flux in the root zone becomes decoupled from the ground water system and subsequent precipitation does little to contribute to streamflow for the current year, but serves to offset ET and the soil moisture deficit at the beginning of the following year. This study demonstrates the merits of long-term catchment-scale research to improve our understanding of how climate and land cover interact to control hydrologic dynamics in complex mountainous terrain.

	abstract = {High spatial variability of wind over mountain landscapes can create strong gradients in mass and in energy fluxes at the scale of tens of metres. Variable winds are often cited as the cause of high heterogeneity in snow distribution in non-forested mountain locations. Distributed models capable of capturing the variability in these fluxes require a time series of distributed wind data at a comparably fine spatial scale. Application of atmospheric and surface wind flow models in these regions has been limited by our ability to represent this complex process in a computationally efficient manner. Simplified models based on terrain and vegetation parameters are not as explicit as more complex, fluid-flow models, but are computationally efficient for real-time operational use. We developed and applied a simplified wind model based on analysis of upwind terrain to predict wind speeds across diverse topographies at three mountainous research locations. Each site was instrumented with a network of wind sensors to capture the full range of wind variability present. Differences in upwind topography were significantly related (p < 0.0001) to wind-speed differences between sites. Wind speeds at each sensor location were modelled from each of the other intra-site locations as if data from only one sensor were available. The wind model explained 69\% of the observed variance with a mean absolute prediction error of 0-8 m/s, 19\% of the observed wind mean. These results were very encouraging given the inherent complexity and profound variability of processes determining wind patterns in these systems. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Although soil processes affect the timing and amount of streamflow generated from snowmelt, they are often overlooked in estimations of snowmelt-generated streamflow in the western USA. The use of a soil water balance modelling approach to incorporate the effects of soil processes, in particular soil water storage, on the timing and amount of snowmelt generated streamflow, was investigated. The study was conducted in the Reynolds Mountain East (RME) watershed, a 38 ha, snowmelt-dominated watershed in southwest Idaho. Snowmelt or rainfall inputs to the soil were determined using a well established snow accumulation and melt model (Isnobal). The soil water balance model was first evaluated at a point scale, using periodic soil water content measurements made over two years at 14 sites. In general, the simulated soil water profiles were in agreement with measurements (P < 0.05) as further indicated by high R-2 values (mostly >0.85), y-intercept values near 0, slopes near 1 and low average differences between measured and modelled values. In addition, observed soil water dynamics were generally consistent with critical model assumptions. Spatially distributed simulations over the watershed for the same two years indicate that streamflow initiation and cessation are closely linked to the overall watershed soil water storage capacity, which acts as a threshold. When soil water storage was below the threshold, streamflow was insensitive to snowmelt inputs, but once the threshold was crossed, the streamflow response was very rapid. At these times there was a relatively high degree of spatial continuity of satiated soils within the watershed. Incorporation of soil water storage effects may improve estimation of the timing and amount of streamflow generated from mountainous watersheds dominated by snowmelt.

	abstract = {During the second year of the NASA Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX), an eddy covariance (EC) system was deployed at the Local Scale Observation Site (LSOS) from mid-February to June 2003. The EC system was located beneath a uniform pine canopy, where the trees are regularly spaced and are of similar age and height. In an effort to evaluate the turbulent flux calculations of an energy balance snowmelt model (SNOBAL), modeled and EC-measured sensible and latent heat fluxes between the snow cover and the atmosphere during this period are presented and compared. Turbulent fluxes comprise a large component of the snow cover energy balance in the premelt and ripening period (March-early May) and therefore control the internal energy content of the snow cover as melt accelerates in late spring. Simulated snow cover depth closely matched measured values (RMS difference 8.3 cm; Nash-Sutcliff model efficiency 0.90), whereas simulated snow cover mass closely matched the few measured values taken during the season. Over the 927-h comparison period using the default model configuration, simulated sensible heat H was within 1 W m(-2), latent heat L nu E within 4 W m(-2), and cumulative sublimation within 3 mm of that measured by the EC system. Differences between EC-measured and simulated fluxes occurred primarily at night. The reduction of the surface layer specification in the model from 25 to 10 cm reduced flux differences between EC-measured and modeled fluxes to 0 W m(-2) for H, 2 W m(-2) for L nu E, and 1 mm for sublimation. When only daytime fluxes were compared, differences were further reduced to 1 W m(-2) for L nu E and < 1 mm for sublimation. This experiment shows that in addition to traditional mass balance methods, EC-measured fluxes can be used to diagnose the performance of a snow cover energy balance model. It also demonstrates the use of eddy covariance methods for measuring heat and mass fluxes from snow covers at a low-wind, below-canopy site.},

	abstract = {Energy budget dynamics under forest canopies are strongly influenced by the large spatial variability of radiative and turbulent transfers in this environment. Incoming solar radiation under canopies has a particularly high degree of spatial variability. Transmission of solar radiation through a forest canopy varies with the size and location of the canopy gaps, as well as canopy leaf area. Modeling this transmission has proven challenging owing to the highly variable nature of the gaps within and between tree crowns, particularly in discontinuous canopies. This study describes and simulates the solar variability incident on the snow surface beneath two conifer forests.

Objectives of this work are (1) to evaluate the variability of incoming solar radiation data with respect to canopy structure and cloudiness, (2) to correlate measured solar radiation transmission with predicted solar transmission based on analysis of hemispherical photographs, and (3) to examine the impact of measured and predicted transmission factors on the seasonal net radiative exchanges and snow ablation, based on snow process modeling. Observations were made during the winters of 2002 and 2003 in two predominately lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands, one discontinuous and one relatively uniform, at the Local Scale Observation Site (LSOS) in Fraser, CO, USA, as part of the Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX). The canopy structure of all trees in the 0.8 ha triangular plot was measured and mapped in detail. We measured incoming global solar radiation at the snow surface beneath the discontinuous and the uniform canopies using arrays of 10 upward looking pyranometers at each site. Incoming global solar radiation was also measured above the canopy. Hemispherical photographs were taken with a Nikon Coolpix 995 with a fisheye converter at each radiometer location in both canopies, and were analyzed with Gap Light Analyzer (GLA) software. We found good agreement between measured and GLA-predicted transmissivities (r(2) = 0.86) when all data from both years were considered. Transmission factors derived from hemispheric photos and GLA software can be used to specify the distribution of solar flux under a canopy, instead of direct solar flux measurements, without degradation in snow model melt predictions.

	abstract = {In mountainous regions, topographic structure and vegetation control patterns of snow deposition, climate conditions, and snowmelt. A topographically distributed snow accumulation and melt model (ISNOBAL) was coupled to a wind field and snow redistribution model to simulate the development and ablation of the seasonal snow cover over a small mountainous catchment, the Reynolds Mountain East basin (0.38 km(2)) in southwestern Idaho, USA. The model was driven by hourly terrain- and canopy-corrected data grids derived from meteorological data from two stations located within the catchment for four water years (1986, 1987, 1989 and 1997). The catchment was divided into four shelter classes, based on terrain and vegetation; these were used for an analysis of how the mass and energy balance of the snowcover varies over the basin as a function of terrain and forest characteristics for each of the selected years. As shown by the simulations and verified by detailed point measurements and the late-season areal photographs of snow-covered area, in all years the wind-exposed areas developed thinner snow covers and were essentially bare of snow prior to the onset of spring meltout in wind-sheltered areas. The meltout of the wind-sheltered drift and canopy-enclosed regions occurred in conjunction with the springtime increase in solar radiation generating the bulk of springtime runoff. Melt contributions from the drifts may continue into the late spring and early summer. This research uses a unique set of point and spatial verification data to show that a snow accumulation and ablation model, adjusted for wind redistribution effects, reliably simulated the topographic and vegetation influences on snow distribution, the energy balance, and the hydrology of snow and wind-dominated mountainous regions.

	abstract = {In the Pacific Northwest of North America, significant flooding can occur during mid-winter rain-on-snow events. Warm.. wet Pacific storms caused significant floods in the Pacific Northwest in February 1996, January 1997 and January 1998. Rapid melting of the mountain snow cover substantially augmented discharge during these flood events. An energy-balance snowmelt model is used to simulate snowmelt processes during the January 1997 event over a small headwater basin within the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed located in the Owyhee Mountains of southwestern Idaho, U.S.A. This sub-basin is 34\% forested (12\% fir, 22\% aspen and 66\% mixed sagebrush (primarily mountain big sagebrush)), Data from paired open and forested experimental sites were used to drive the model. Model-forcing data were corrected for topographic and vegetation canopy effects. The event was preceded by cold, stormy conditions that developed a significant snow cover over the subbasin. The snow cover at sites protected by forest cover was slightly reduced, while at open sites significant snowmelt occurred. The warm, moist, windy conditions during the flooding event produced substantially higher melt rates in exposed areas, where sensible- and latent-heat exchanges contributed 60-90\% of the energy for snowmelt. Simulated snow-cover development and ablation during the model run closely matched measured conditions at the two experimental sites. This experiment shows the sensitivity of snowmelt processes to both climate and land cover, and illustrates how the forest canopy is coupled to the hydrologic cycle in mountainous areas.},

	abstract = {The influence of snow microstructure on thermal and radiative transfer in snow has not been thoroughly investigated as the tools necessary to efficiently measure microstructural geometry at millimeter resolution have not yet been available. Here we investigate the impact of snow microstructure on the thermal and radiative properties of snow and specifically determine the depth resolution of snow stratigraphy measurements needed to adequately model snow temperatures. To address this subject, detailed information on physical properties of the snow cover was collected at Summit, Greenland, in summer 2003. We present a new set of snow microstructure data, measured with a high-resolution penetrometer (SnowMicroPen (SMP)). The penetration resistance can be used to estimate the thickness of individual layers but also reflects the thickness and the number of bonds in the snowpack. SMP is a motor-driven, constant speed micropenetrometer acquiring 256 hardness measurements per millimeter. The data were used to describe the physical properties of snow and to compute snow temperatures in the topmost meter of the snowpack using the snow cover model SNOWPACK. The spatial resolution of the snow microstructure and the subsequent parametrization of SMP-estimated density strongly affected the modeled temperature and temperature gradients. The SMP-estimated density was used as an input to SNOWPACK and affected the thermal conductivity and radiative transfer in the snowpack. Our results thus show that highly resolved stratigraphic input data on the order of at least 1 cm are necessary to adequately simulate snow temperatures and snow metamorphism, including the observed formation of subsurface hoar in the high Arctic snow cover.},

	abstract = {Fabric tensors quantify the directional arrangement of a granular material's microstructure. In treating snow as such they are beneficial in characterizing morphologies that exhibit a distinct directional arrangement like chains of grains in depth hoar and potentially other weak layers. Microstructural variables, including the directional arrangement of bonds, impact thermo-mechanical properties like strength, stiffness, and conductivity of the granular material. The conductivity model proposed here incorporates a fabric tensor, linking the textural arrangement of a granular assembly to a material property.

In this work, dry dense snow was subject to temperature gradients (100 and 50 K/m) in a lab. The resulting morphology was driven by temperature gradient metamorphism. Underpinning the importance of microstructure, the observed heat transfer coefficient (EHC) increased in the direction of the applied gradient without appreciable changes in density. Periodic tomography yielded measurable microstructural data used to calculate a fabric tensor and the evolving conductivity tensor. Through the fabric tensor the analytical conduction model accounts for -43\% of the observed increase in EHC. The model also calculates a decrease in conductivity in the plane orthogonal to the temperature gradient due to a developing anisotropy. Snow metamorphism models parameterized by density alone cannot predict such directionally-dependent behavior because they are strictly valid for only isotropic materials. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The thermal conductivity of snow determines the temperature gradient, and by this, it has a direct effect on the rate of snow metamorphism. It is therefore a key property of snow. However, thermal conductivities measured with the transient needle probe and the steady-state, heat flux plate differ. In addition, the anisotropy of thermal conductivity plays an important role in the accuracy of thermal conductivity measurements. In this study, we investigated three independent methods to measure snow thermal conductivity and its anisotropy: a needle probe with a long heating time, a guarded heat flux plate, and direct numerical simulation at the microstructural level of the pore and ice structure. The three methods were applied to identical snow samples. We analyzed the consistency and the difference between these methods. As already shown in former studies, we observed a distinct difference between the anisotropy of thermal conductivity in small rounded grains and in depth hoar. Indeed, the anisotropy between vertical and horizontal thermal conductivity components ranges between 0.5-2. This can cause a difference in thermal conductivity measurements carried out with needle probes of up to -25\% to +25\% if the thermal conductivity is calculated only from a horizontally inserted needle probe. Based on our measurements and the comparison of the three methods studied here, the direct numerical simulation is the most reliable method, as the tensorial components of the thermal conductivity can be calculated and the corresponding microstructure is precisely known.},

@article{STURM&al:1992,
	abstract = {The effective thermal conductivity of snow (k(eff)), which includes latent heat transfer due to vapor diffusion, was measured during three winters in Fairbanks, Alaska.  In 1986-1987, k(eff) of several layers of snow was monitored in detail as the snow metamorphosed into depth hoar.  Measurements were made using a needle probe with an estimated accuracy of +/- 8\%; k(eff) was found to decrease and then increase as the snow passed from new snow through several distinct stages of depth hoar.  For depth hoar, k(eff) ranged from 0.026 to 0.105, with an average value of 0.063 W m-1 K-1.  This is one half to one fourth the value suggested by most studies for snow of similar density.  For depth hoar of a given type, k(eff) can be represented as a linear function of temperature between 0-degrees and -20-degrees-C but requires a nonlinear function for the range from 0-degrees to -196-degrees-C.  At -196-degrees-C the thermal conductivity of depth hoar approached that of still air, suggesting that conduction through the ice skeleton of the snow was limited and that the increase in k(eff) at temperatures near 0-degrees-C is the result of the strong temperature dependence of water vapor density.  This conclusion is consistent with the nature of the ice bonds in depth hoar, which are thin and relatively few in number.},

	abstract = {Twenty-seven studies on the thermal conductivity of snow (k(eff)) have been published since 1886. Combined, they comprise 354 values of k(eff), and have been used to derive over 13 regression equations predicting k(eff) vs density. Due to large (and largely undocumented) differences in measurement methods and accuracy, sample temperature and snow type, it is not possible to know what part of the variability in this data set is the result of snow microstructure. We present a new data set containing 488 measurements for which the temperature, type and measurement accuracy are known. A quadratic equation,

[GRAPHICS]

where rho is in g cm(-3), and k(eff) is in W m(-1)K(-1), can be fit to the new data (R-2=0.79). A logarithmic expression,

[GRAPHICS]

can also be used. The first regression is better when estimating values beyond the limits of the data; the second when estimating values for low-density snow. Within the data set, snow types resulting from kinetic growth show density-independent behavior. rounded-grain and wind-blown snow show strong density dependence. The new data set has a higher mean value of density but a lower mean value of thermal conductivity than the old set. This shift is attributed to differences in snow types and sample temperatures in the sets. Using both data sets, we show that there are well-defined limits to the geometric configurations that natural seasonal snow can take.},

@article{Pettit&al:2011,
	abstract = {We used observations and modeling of Sip le Dome, West Antarctica, a ridge ice divide, to infer the importance of linear deformation mechanisms in ice-sheet flow. We determined the crossover stress (a threshold value of the effective deviatoric stress below which linear flow mechanisms dominate over nonlinear flow mechanisms) by combining measurements of ice properties with in situ deformation rate measurements and a finite-element ice flow model that accounts for the effects of viscous anisotropy induced by preferred crystal-orientation fabric. We found that a crossover stress of 0.18 bar produces the best match between predicted and observed deformation rates. For Sip le Dome, this means that including a linear term in the flow law is necessary, but generally the flow is still dominated by the nonlinear (Glen; n = 3) term. The pattern of flow near the divide at Sip le Dome is also strongly affected by crystal fabric. Measurements of sonic velocity, which is a proxy for vertically oriented crystal fabric, suggest that a bed-parallel shear band exists several hundred meters above the bed within the Ice Age ice.},

	abstract = {A new rheology that explicitly accounts for the subcontinuum anisotropy of the sea ice cover is implemented into the Los Alamos sea ice model. This is in contrast to all models of sea ice included in global circulation models that use an isotropic rheology. The model contains one new prognostic variable, the local structure tensor, which quantifies the degree of anisotropy of the sea ice, and two parameters that set the time scale of the evolution of this tensor. The anisotropic rheology provides a subcontinuum description of the mechanical behavior of sea ice and accounts for a continuum scale stress with large shear to compression ratio and tensile stress component. Results over the Arctic of a stand-alone version of the model are presented and anisotropic model sensitivity runs are compared with a reference elasto-visco-plastic simulation. Under realistic forcing sea ice quickly becomes highly anisotropic over large length scales, as is observed from satellite imagery. The influence of the new rheology on the state and dynamics of the sea ice cover is discussed. Our reference anisotropic run reveals that the new rheology leads to a substantial change of the spatial distribution of ice thickness and ice drift relative to the reference standard visco-plastic isotropic run, with ice thickness regionally increased by more than 1 m, and ice speed reduced by up to 50\%.},

	abstract = {The dielectric permittivities parallel and perpendicular to the c axis (optic axis) of ice lh were measured using an open resonator at 39 GHz in the temperature range 194-262 K. The dielectric anisotropy in ice at microwave frequencies is important for understanding remote sensing data in polar regions, obtained by ice radar and satellite-born microwave radar and radiometer. The measured samples were natural single-crystal ice collected from Mendenhall Glacier, Alaska. A very precise measurement was achieved by detecting two resonant peaks, one from the ordinary component and the other from the extraordinary component, simultaneously, from one sample. The real part of dielectric anisotropy, Delta epsilon' = epsilon(parallel to c)' - epsilon(perpendicular to c)', at 39 GHz was 0.0339+/-0.0007 (1.07\%+/-0.02\%) at 252 K and slightly depended on temperature. Reference measurements at 1 MHz using parallel plate electrodes were also carried out. The measured dielectric anisotropy at microwave frequencies agrees very well with the value at 1 MHz. The absolute values of epsilon(parallel to c)' and epsilon(perpendicular to c)' at 39 GHz were, respectively, smaller than those at 1 MHz and the difference was about 0.044 at 252 K. The results suggest that a small dispersion exists between GHz and MHz frequencies, but there is no frequency dependence in the value of anisotropy. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {Anisotropy in englacial radar power was measured using 60-MHz and 179-MHz copolarized pulse-modulated radar at 19 sites in central West Antarctica. The study region is a 100 x 300 km(2) area near the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide that separates ice flow toward the Ross and Amundsen Embayments. The frequency dependence of the returned power indicates that most of the radar data are affected by vertical variations in the crystal-orientation fabric (COF), though the 60-MHz data are more affected by acidity contrasts in the top 1000 m. Significant polarimetric variations occur at most sites, likely due to effects of the anisotropic COF patterns. More anisotropic variations occur at sites with significant horizontal strain, whereas more isotropic variations occur at sites where vertical compression dominates. Azimuthal shifts with depth of the principal axes of COF were found in shallow ice near the current flow divide and at greater depths over locations of rough bed. The former indicates that the divide has differentially migrated, resulting in a rotation of the principal COF axes. Nevertheless, the regionally consistent radar signatures suggest that the first-order ice properties in this area have remained constant and that no major changes in the strain configuration or ice topography have occurred for the past five to eight thousand years. We conclude that shallow polarimetric features can be related to the current strain configurations, and that englacial polarimetric features can help constrain current ice rheology and evolution of the ice topography.},

	abstract = {Colinear-polarized 5 MHz radar profiling data were obtained on Mrdalsjokull, a temperate glacier in Iceland. Radar transects, and therefore polarization planes, were aligned approximately parallel, transverse and oblique to the ice flow direction. Echoes from the shallower half to two-thirds of the ice were 10-20dB stronger on the oblique and longitudinal transects than those on the transverse transects. Anisotropy as a function of depth is clearly seen at the sites where the transects cross. Strong scattering on longitudinal transects apparently caused extinction of a radar-reflecting layer that was continuously profiled on the transverse transects. A radio-wave scattering model shows that scattering from a longitudinal water-filled conduit parallel to the glacier surface can explain the observed azimuthal variations of the echo. We conclude that low-frequency (similar to MHz) radio waves can help to characterize englacial water regimes.},

	abstract = {The Phased-Array L-Band SAR (PALSAR) aboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) is capable of globally acquiring fully polarimetric data. In order to confirm the ability of L-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to investigate sea ice before the ALOS launch, we conducted a field experiment using an airborne Polarimetric and Interferometric SAR (Pi-SAR) in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1999. This paper presents the analyzed results of data acquired in that experiment. The extracted polarimetric parameters of several ice types suggested that polarimetric coherences and phase differences between right-right (RR) and left-left (LL) are good candidates for discriminating ice types. The polarimetric anisotropy as well as the beta angle of the first eigenvector calculated in the polarimetric decomposition procedure are alternative parameters that are sensitive to ice type differences. Due to the low depolarization characteristics of open water, it could be discriminated from sea ice by scattering entropy in all incidence angle ranges. From the relation between ice thickness and the polarimetric parameters, we found that backscattering coefficients and vertical (W) to horizontal (HH) backscattering ratio are highly correlated with ice thickness. Since the ratio is sensitive to ice surface dielectric constants, a simple simulation using the integral equation method surface model was conducted by using the physical parameters of typical sea ice. A two-dimensional ice thickness map was derived from an empirical relation between the VV-to-HH backscattering ratio and ice thickness.},

	abstract = {This study analyzes spatial variability of snow depth and density from measurements made in February and April of 2010 and 2011 in three 1-2 km(2) areas within a valley of the central Spanish Pyrenees. Snow density was correlated with snow depth and different terrain characteristics. Regression models were used to predict the spatial variability of snow density, and to assess how the error in computed densities might influence estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE).

The variability in snow depth was much greater than that of snow density. The average snow density was much greater in April than in February. The correlations between snow depth and density were generally statistically significant but typically not very high, and their magnitudes and signs were highly variable among sites and surveys. The correlation with other topographic variables showed the same variability in magnitude and sign, and consequently the resulting regression models were very inconsistent, and in general explained little of the variance. Antecedent climatic and snow conditions prior to each survey help highlight the main causes of the contrasting relation shown between snow depth, density and terrain. As a consequence of the moderate spatial variability of snow density relative to snow depth, the absolute error in the SWE estimated from computed densities using the regression models was generally less than 15\%. The error was similar to that obtained by relating snow density measurements directly to adjacent snow depths. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The snow water equivalent (SWE) characterizes the hydrological significance of snow cover. However, measuring SWE is time-consuming, thus alternative methods of determining SWE may be useful. SWE can be calculated from snow depth if the bulk snow density is known. Thus, a reliable estimation method of snow densities could (a) potentially save a lot of effort by, at least partly, sampling snow depth instead of SWE, and would (b) allow snow hydrological evaluations, when only snow depth data are available. To generate a useful parameterization of the bulk density a large dataset was analyzed covering snow densities and depths measured biweekly over five decades at 37 sites throughout the Swiss Alps. Four factors were identified to affect the bulk snow density: season, snow depth, site altitude, and site location. These factors constitute a convenient set of input variables for a snow density model developed in this study. The accuracy of estimating SWE using our model is shown to be equivalent to the variability of repeated SWE measurements at one site. The technique may therefore allow a more efficient but indirect sampling of the SWE without necessarily affecting the data quality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Derksen&al:2010,
	abstract = {Airborne and satellite brightness temperature (T-B) measurements were combined with intensive field observations of sub-Arctic tundra snow cover to develop the framework for a new tundra-specific passive microwave snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval algorithm. The dense snowpack and high sub-grid lake fraction across the tundra mean that conventional brightness temperature difference approaches (such as the commonly used 37 GHz-19 GHz) are not appropriate across the sub-Arctic. Airborne radiometer measurements (with footprint dimensions of approximately 70x120 m) acquired across sub-Arctic Canada during three field campaigns during the 2008 winter season were utilized to illustrate a slope reversal in the 37 GHz T-B versus SWE relationship. Scattering by the tundra snowpack drives a negative relationship until a threshold SWE value is reached near 130 mm at which point emission from the snowpack creates a positive but noisier relationship between 37 GHz T-B and SWE.

The change from snowpack scattering to emission was also evident in the temporal evolution of 37 GHz T-B observed from satellite measurements. AMSR-E brightness temperatures (2002/03-2006/07) consistently exhibited decreases through the winter before reaching a minimum in February or March, followed by an increase for weeks or months before melt. The cumulative absolute change (Sigma vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar) in vertically polarized 37 GHz T-B was computed at both monthly and pentad intervals from a January 1 start date and compared to ground measured SWE from intensive and regional snow survey campaigns, and climate station observations. A greater (lower) cumulative change in vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar was significantly related to greater (lower) ground measured SWE (r(2) = 0.77 with monthly averages: r(2) = 0.67 with pentad averages). Sigma vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar was only weakly correlated with lake fraction: monthly r(2) values calculated for January through April 2003-2007 were largely less than 0.2. These results indicate that this is a computationally straightforward and viable algorithmic framework for producing tundra-specific SWE datasets from the complete satellite passive microwave record (1979 to present).

	abstract = {In many practical applications snow depth is known, but snow water equivalent (SWE) is needed as well. Measuring SWE takes similar to 20 times as long as measuring depth, which in part is why depth measurements outnumber SWE measurements worldwide. Here a method of estimating snow bulk density is presented and then used to convert snow depth to SWE. The method is grounded in the fact that depth varies over a range that is many times greater than that of bulk density. Consequently, estimates derived from measured depths and modeled densities generally fall close to measured values of SWE. Knowledge of snow climate classes is used to improve the accuracy of the estimation procedure. A statistical model based on a Bayesian analysis of a set of 25 688 depth-density-SWE data collected in the United States, Canada, and Switzerland takes snow depth, day of the year, and the climate class of snow at a selected location from which it produces a local bulk density estimate. When converted to SWE and tested against two continental-scale datasets, 90\% of the computed SWE values fell within +/- 8 cm of the measured values, with most estimates falling much closer.},

	abstract = {During the International Polar Year (IPY), comprehensive observational research programs were undertaken to increase our understanding of the Canadian polar cryosphere response to a changing climate. Cryospheric components considered were snow, permafrost, sea ice, freshwater ice, glaciers and ice shelves. Enhancement of conventional observing systems and retrieval algorithms for satellite measurements facilitated development of a snapshot of current cryospheric conditions, providing a baseline against which future change can be assessed. Key findings include: 1. surface air temperatures across the Canadian Arctic exhibit a warming trend in all seasons over the past 40 years. A consistent pan-cryospheric response to these warming temperatures is evident through the analysis of multi-decadal datasets; 2. in recent years (including the IPY period) a higher rate of change was observed compared to previous decades including warming permafrost, reduction in snow cover extent and duration, reduction in summer sea ice extent, increased mass loss from glaciers, and thinning and break-up of the remaining Canadian ice shelves. These changes illustrate both a reduction in the spatial extent and mass of the cryosphere and an increase in the temporal persistence of melt related parameters. The observed changes in the cryosphere have important implications for human activity including the close ties of northerners to the land, access to northern regions for natural resource development, and the integrity of northern infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Large-scale snow hydrology has been studied via spaceborne passive microwave (PM) measurements for decades. Forward and inverse radiative transfer (RT) models of snow are utilized in this context but typically neglect snow stratigraphy. Our objective in this paper is to characterize the expected model error in PM brightness temperature (T-b) predictions due to neglecting stratigraphy over a range of snow cover conditions. For 191 snow-pits ranging from prairie to alpine, we performed side-by-side RT model runs including and ignoring stratigraphy via mass-weighted averages across stratigraphic layers; error was estimated by comparing the two RT model runs. Neglecting stratigraphy at 37 GHz led to approximately 10-K root mean square error (RMSE) for moderately deep (alpine) snow cover and to approximately 5-K RMSE for shallower (prairie) snow. RMSE across all types of snow was 1.67 and 26.9 K at 18.7 and 89 GHz, respectively. At 37 GHz, there was a low bias for deep snowpacks and a high bias for moderate-to-shallow snowpacks. Bias magnitude bias was dependent on vertical grain size variability. Based on these results and estimates of sensitivity of Tb to snow depth, we estimated that snow depth RMSE due to neglecting stratigraphy approaches 50\%.},

	abstract = {A method for automated and fast classification of snow texture would be useful for applications where snow structure must be quantified. Large numbers of field measurements were carried out on natural snow in order to investigate small-scale variations of the micro-penetration force. Snow characterization was done for snow from the Himalaya and the Alps, using a high-resolution snow penetrometer (SnowMicroPen). Measurements of snow resistance at equal intervals of 4 mu m were geostatistically evaluated. The range parameter (correlation length, or CL) of penetration force was estimated for all major snow classes from the sample semivariogram. Average CL was lowest for new snow and highest for melt freeze snow. For major snow classes, CL was found to increase with snow density. Ground-perpendicular and ground-parallel snow profiles were also obtained for homogeneous snow, and CL was estimated along these directions. New snow showed larger CL in the ground-parallel direction, and depth-hoar snow showed larger CL in the ground-perpendicular direction. Based on CL, the directional anisotropy was calculated. An attempt was also made to show the relationship between CL and texture index. The semivariogram was used to estimate the fractal dimension. Both CL and fractal dimension were found to be potential parameters to describe snow.},

@article{Satyawali&al:2009,
	abstract = {Objective and accurate observations of snowpack layering and properties are essential for avalanche warning. Human observations are helpful, but they are often highly subjective and therefore inconsistent making them difficult to interpret. In this paper we address this problem by applying a high-resolution penetrometer to determine snowpack properties. We develop an algorithm to characterize the different snow microstructure classes using the signal obtained from the penetrometer measurements. For this purpose a database consisting of various snow profiles of Alpine snow was created, which contains the records of the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of penetration resistance over 1 mm depth. The algorithm is able to characterize the major snow classes, namely, new snow, faceted snow, depth hoar, rounded grains and melt-freeze with an acceptable accuracy for warning purposes. We find that new snow, depth hoar and melt-freeze snow layers are characterized better than the rounded grains and faceted snow layers. However, knowledge-based rules, formulated from the experience of field researchers, can further improve the automated snow profiling procedure. For a comprehensive prediction of snow classes with better accuracy, it is proposed in future to include more expert rules and to enlarge the database of measurements. This preliminary approach could be helpful in validating numerical simulation models of snowpacks and subsequently numerical avalanche forecasting. The potential application of snow class information derived from the SMP to infer the specific surface area of snow layers is also discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Over the 28 months from spring 2004 to summer 2006 the average error over 100 km sections of the traverse ranged from -0.006 to 0.100 m a(-1). The lowest values, comparable with the system accuracy of the CryoSat radar altimeter (0.033 m a(-1)), were found below 3000 m. The surface density required to translate the elevation change into mass change decreased from 0.40 g cm(-3) at an elevation of 2348 m to 0.33 g cm(-3) at an elevation of 3264 m. From the density profiles the equivalent values for a time period of 10 years were found to be 0.48 and 0.38 g cm(-3), respectively.},

@article{Hock&al:2003,
	abstract = {Temperature index or degree-day models rest upon a claimed relationship between snow or ice melt and air temperature usually expressed in the form of positive temperatures. Since air temperature generally is the most readily available data, such models have been the most widely used method of ice and snow melt computations for many purposes, such as hydrological modelling, ice dynamic modelling or climate sensitivity studies. Despite their simplicity, temperature-index models have proven to be powerful tools for melt modelling, often on a catchment scale outperforming energy balance models. However, two shortcomings are evident: (1) although working well over long time periods their accuracy decreases with increasing temporal resolution; (2) spatial variability cannot be modelled accurately as melt rates may vary substantially due to topographic effects such as shading, slope and aspect angles. These effects are particularly crucial in mountain areas. This paper provides an overview of temperature-index methods, including glacier environments, and discusses recent advances on distributed approaches attempting to account for topographic effects in complex terrain, while retaining scarcity of data input. In the light of an increasing demand for melt estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution, such approaches need further refinement and development. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Snowmelt is the principal source for soil moisture, ground-water re-charge, and stream-flow in mountainous regions of the western US, Canada, and other similar regions of the world. Information on the timing, magnitude, and contributing area of melt under variable or changing climate conditions is required for successful water and resource management. A coupled energy and mass-balance model ISNOBAL is used to simulate the development and melting of the seasonal snowcover in several mountain basins in California, Idaho, and Utah. Simulations are done over basins varying from 1 to 2500 km(2), with simulation periods varying from a few days for the smallest basin, Emerald Lake watershed in California, to multiple snow seasons for the Park City area in Utah. The model is driven by topographically corrected estimates of radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. Simulation results in all basins closely match independently measured snow water equivalent, snow depth, or runoff during both the development and depletion of the snowcover. Spatially distributed estimates of snow deposition and melt allow us to better understand the interaction between topographic structure, climate, and moisture availability in mountain basins of the western US. Application of topographically distributed models such as this will lead to improved water resource and watershed management. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Significant differences in snow deposition, development of the seasonal snow cover, and the timing of melt can occur over small spatial distances because of differences in topographically controlled wind exposure and canopy cover. To capture important intrabasin hydrological processes related to heterogeneous snow cover and energy inputs, models must explicitly account for these differences. The "SNOBAL'' point snow cover energy and mass balance model is used to evaluate differences in snow cover energy and mass balance at two sites in a small headwater drainage of the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in the Owyhee Mountains of southwestern Idaho. Though these sites are separated by only 350 m, they are located in distinctly different snow cover regimes. The "ridge'' site (elevation 2097 m) is located on a broad shelf on the southern ridge of RCEW, and the "grove'' site (elevation 2061 m) is sheltered by topography and forest canopy in a grove of aspen and fir trees just in the lee of the ridge on which the ridge site is located. Precipitation and climate data from these sites were used to drive SNOBAL for three water years: the 1984 water year, the largest discharge year on record; the 1992 water year, the smallest discharge year on record; and the very windy 1999 water year. Simulated energy balance during meltout at the ridge site was dominated by sensible heat flux; at the grove site the primary energy input during meltout was net allwave radiation. Comparison of total annual snowmelt with measured stream discharge from this headwater drainage showed that neither site adequately represented the basin input of water in any of the model years. This analysis details the disparity in energy and mass fluxes during the snow accumulation and ablation cycle between two proximal sites, illustrating the importance of understanding and spatially accounting for variable energy inputs and snow deposition patterns.},

	abstract = {In mountainous regions, wind plays a prominent role in determining snow accumulation patterns and turbulent heat exchanges, strongly affecting the timing and magnitude of snowmelt runoff. In this study, digital terrain analysis was employed to quantify aspects of the upwind topography related to wind shelter and exposure, to efficiently develop a distributed time-series of snow accumulation rates and wind speeds to force a distributed snow model. Parameters are presented that determined each grid cell's topographic exposure and potential for drift development relative to observed winds. Using meteorological data taken from both an exposed and a sheltered site in the Reynolds Mountain East watershed (0.38 km(2)) in southwestern Idaho, the terrain parameters were used to distribute rates of snow accumulation and wind speeds at an hourly time step for input to ISNOBAL, an energy and mass balance snow model. Model runs were initiated prior to the development of the seasonal snow cover and continued through complete meltout for the 1986 (precipitation 128\% of average), 1987 (66\%), and 1989 (108\%) water years. A comprehensive dataset consisting of a time series of aerial photographs taken during meltout, measured runoff, and snow data from the sheltered meteorological site were used to validate the simulations. ISNOBAL forced with accumulation rates and wind fields generated from the applied terrain parameterizations accurately modelled the observed snow distribution (including the formation of drifts and scoured wind-exposed ridges) and snowmelt runoff for all three years of study. By contrast, ISNOBAL forced with spatially constant accumulation rates and wind speeds taken from the sheltered meteorological site, a typical snow-monitoring site, overestimated peak snowmelt inputs and tended to underestimate snowmelt inputs prior to the runoff peak.

	abstract = {This paper describes the current state of a complete automatic system of three numerical models that simulate snow-cover stratigraphy and avalanche risks for operational avalanche forecasting. The first model, SAFRAN, estimates relevant meteorological parameters affecting snowpack evolution. The second, Crocus, is a snow numerical model which simulates the physical processes inside the snowpack and its stratigraphy; The last model, MEPRA, is an expert system; based on an assessment of snowpack stability, it deduces natural and accidental avalanche risks. To describe the great variability of the snowpack and the associated avalanche risks, this automatic system simulates snow-cover evolution and its stability for many typical slopes, elevations and aspects representative of the different French massifs. To achieve this result, different kinds of validations have been carried out since winter 1981; they are mainly based on comparisons with different sets of measurements and on the opinion of users.

Although the routinely obtained results do not yet take into account all small-scale effects such as wind transport, they have been considered as valuable information by avalanche forecasters since 1992-93 and used operationally since then.},

@article{Albert&al:2008,
	abstract = {Measurements were conducted to determine the effect of a snow cover on acoustic wave propagation during a 50 day period in Alaska. Acoustic waveforms produced by a blank pistol shot were recorded after propagating horizontally over various snow-covered propagation paths and were used to determine the snow cover parameters by comparison with theoretically calculated waveforms. This automatic comparison procedure was successful in determining the average snow cover permeability and depth even when the snow cover depth varied greatly across the propagation path. Although the snow cover properties remained relatively constant during the measurement period, the acoustic measurements were able to determine the changes caused by wind events and new snowfall. Acoustic measurements can provide a rapid, accurate method for determining and monitoring snow cover characteristics. The excess attenuation produced by the snow cover was generally about -30 dB for 100 in distance and frequencies above 100 Hz. Theoretical calculations also show that even a thin snow cover only 0.02 m thick will affect acoustic pulse propagation. The attenuation and distortion caused by a snow cover can degrade passive acoustic sensor identification and distance estimation, but these detrimental effects can be mitigated by proper design of signal processing algorithms.

	abstract = {The possibility of determining snow water equivalent (SWE) by the use of an acoustic impulse was assessed at two field locations in Saskatchewan and British Columbia, Canada. These sites represent cold windswept prairie and temperate deep mountain snowcovers. A continuous frequency-swept acoustic wave was sent into the snowpack and received. Signal processing was then subsequently used to estimate the depth and density of each snow layer by a recursive relationship involving frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and seismological techniques. From this method, it is also shown that the tortuosity of snow can be estimated. Data collected by gravimetric sampling was used as comparison to the SWE values determined by the use of acoustic sounding. The results showed that for the Saskatchewan sites, the correlation between the measured and the modeled values of SWE was 0.86, whereas at the British Columbia sites, the correlation was 0.78. The difference in the correlations was interpreted as being due to additional acoustic measurement error at the British Columbia sites caused by higher liquid water contents and more layers in the snowpack. The measured and the modeled SWE for Saskatchewan snowpacks with high liquid water contents were found to be weakly associated with correlations of 0.30. The acoustically-determined values of tortuosity were close to unity (alpha approximate to 1), which is in agreement with the values characteristic of snow as a porous substance. Further research is necessary to determine whether this technique can be applied to snow in other environmental conditions. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Acoustic surface waves have been detected propagating outdoors under natural conditions. Two critical experimental conditions were employed to ensure the conclusive detection of these waves. First, acoustic pulses rather than a continuous wave source allowed an examination of the waveform shape and avoided the masking of wave arrivals. Second, a snow cover provided favorable ground impedance conditions for surface waves to exist. The acoustic pulses were generated by blank pistol shots fired 1 m above the snow. The resultant waveforms were measured using a vertical array of six microphones located 60 in away from the source at heights between 0.1 and 4.75 m. A strong, low frequency "tail" following the initial arrival was recorded near the snow surface. This tail, and its exponential decay with height (z) above the surface (similar toe(-alphaz)), are diagnostic features of surface waves. The measured attenuation coefficient a was 0.28 m(-1). The identification of the surface wave is confirmed by comparing the measured waveforms with waveforms predicted by the theoretical evaluation of the explicit surface wave pole term using residue theory.

We re-state this idea and describe the fluctuating penetration force as a Poisson shot noise process. This allows us to derive simple analytical expressions for the cumulants and the co-variance of the penetration force in terms of the micromechanical, force-displacement parameters of individual elements. Vice versa, the micromechanical parameters can be estimated from the statistics of the penetration force. We test our method with simulated shot noise processes and real snow profiles and reveal potential limitations of the underlying assumptions. Our model unifies different previous approaches to snow classification which are based on snow penetration resistance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Measurements of snow using a high-resolution micropenetrometer can be used to discriminate between different snow types; in lower-density snow the signal is sensitive to microstructure, and micromechanical properties can be estimated. Although a physics-based snow penetration theory was first developed almost a decade ago, since that time the majority of studies using snow micropenetrometers have focused on using direct hardness measurements in statistical relationships. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to rigorously test the existing physics-based snow micropenetration theories over a wide range of parameters. These tests revealed four major sources of error in the inversion, which are corrected in this analysis. It is shown that this improved inversion algorithm can recover micromechanical parameters in synthetic data with much greater accuracy over the entire range of micromechanical properties observed in natural snow. Detailed examples of the inversion results are shown for eight different snow types, collected in both Alaskan and alpine snowpacks. The resulting micromechanical properties are distinctly different, indicating that a snow characterization from snow micropenetrometer estimates of micromechanical properties is likely possible. Estimates of the microscale elastic modulus, microscale strength, and structural element length make sense physically when compared to the qualitative descriptions of the different snow types. Microscale strength estimates are used to estimate macroscale strength values, and results from 33 different snow samples, covering a wide range of densities and snow types, are consistent with previously reported values from macroscale tests.},

	abstract = {The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) collected data from early 2003 to late 2009 with the specific goal of measuring ice-surface elevation changes. While the precision of GLAS instrumentation has been studied over its intended target (ice), its accuracy has only been robustly estimated using independent (terrestrial nonlaser) methods over salt flats. Here, we perform repeat high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS) surveys under four passes of ICESat track 0412 (campaigns L3I, L3J, L2D, and L2E) to compare directly GLAS elevation data footprints to a coincident GPS ground truth near Summit, Greenland. Analysis and comparison of GLAS data with GPS data show a campaign-dependent elevation bias ranging from -0.112 +/- 0.030 m (L3J) to 0.121 +/- 0.071 m (L2E). Although uncorrected reflectance values and field observations both indicate that forward scattering of the laser signal through the atmosphere accounts for the anomalously negative L3J bias, the biases of all campaigns studied are within the instrument's goal accuracy of +/- 0.15 m. However, our analysis shows a campaign dependence in the bias, which may propagate through estimates of mass balance. The error introduced from intercampaign biases illustrates the importance of long-term independent validation experiments of satellite altimetry data over ice sheets.},

	abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) data are now routinely used for many glaciological applications. In some common cases, systematic errors are unmodelled at the data-processing stage, although they are often presumed insignificant. In this paper, I investigate these assumptions for three different scenarios: (1) measurements on a moving glacier; (2) measurements on a floating ice shelf; and (3) precise height determination over large elevation ranges, such as for aircraft positioning in lidar/laser altimeter missions. In each case, systematic errors are shown to be present in the coordinate solutions that have a far greater magnitude than the formal error estimates produced by the GPS processing software, under certain conditions. If these coordinate biases go undetected, short- and long-term measurements of horizontal ice velocity or rates of ice-thickness change may be erroneous and the coordinates could not be expected to match rigorously processed data or results from different processing techniques. More rigorous processing strategies are discussed that allow for bias-free parameter estimation.},

@article{Bloschl:1999,
	abstract = {The concept of scale can be used to quantify characteristic lengths of (a) a natural process (such as the correlation length of the spatial snow water equivalent (SWE) variability); (b) a measurement (such as the size of a snow density sample or the footprint of a satellite sensor), and (c) a model (such as the grid size of a distributed snow model). The different types of scales are denoted as process scale, measurement scale and model scale, respectively. Interpolations, extrapolations, aggregations, and disaggregations are viewed as a change in model scale and/or measurement scale.

In a first step we examine, in a linear stochastic analysis, the effect of measurement scale and model scale on the data and the model predictions. It is shown that the ratio of the measurement scale and the process scale, and the ratio of the model scale and the process scale are the driving parameters for the scale effects. These scale effects generally cause biases in the variances and spatial correlation lengths of satellite images, field measurements, and simulation results of snow models. It is shown, by example, how these biases can be identified and corrected by regularization methods. At the core of these analyses is the variogram. For the case of snow cover patterns, it is shown that it may be difficult to infer the true snow cover variability from the variograms, particularly when they span many orders of magnitude.

In a second step we examine distributed snow models which are a non-linear deterministic approach to changing the scale. Unlike in the linear case, in these models a change of scale may also bias the mean over a catchment of snow-related variables such as SWE. There are a number of fundamental scaling issues with distributed models which include subgrid variability, the question of an optimum element size, and parameter identifiability. We give methods for estimating subgrid variability. We suggest that, in general, an optimum element size may not exist and that the model element scale may in practice be dictated by data availability and the required resolution of the predictions. The scale effects in distributed non-linear models can be related to the linear stochastic case which allows us to generalize the applicability of regularization methods. While most of the paper focuses on physical snow processes, similar conclusions apply and similar methods are applicable to chemical and biological processes.

	abstract = {Some 27 years of passive microwave satellite observations have demonstrated the value of remote sensing for cryospheric applications, albeit at regional to hemispheric scales due to the relatively large sensor footprints (e.g. similar to 25 km x 25 km for the advanced microwave scanning radiometer). At the other extreme there is the primarily local-scale in situ experience of the snow community. Until higher-resolution sensors become available, understanding the effects of sub-pixel heterogeneity and the downscaling of observations remains an important topic.

In order to provide a baseline for performing scaling studies and for future radiance-based hydrological assimilation schemes, an evaluation of snowpack forward radiance modelling at the plot scale (least heterogeneous scale) is carfied out. Snow microwave radiance models based on dense medium radiative transfer (DMRT) theory incorporate a high degree of physical fidelity, yet dense medium models are particularly sensitive to snowpack structural parameters such as grain size, density, and depth (parameters that may vary substantially within a snowpack). The DMRT performance is evaluated through the use of a fitting technique with respect to snow grain size, a hydrologically important parameter related to the total amount of melt water stored in a snowpack, snowpack metamorphism, vertical energy transport and melt dynamics, as well as various quantities useful in surface energy balance studies. All remaining snow input parameters to the model are derived from snow pit measurements. Model-predicted radiances are evaluated using microwave brightness measurements collected during the NASA Cold Land Process Experiment (CLPX) by the University of Tokyo's Ground-Based Microwave Radiometer-7 (GBMR-7) system at 18.7, 36.5, and 89 GHz, with incidence angles ranging from 30 to 70 degrees. The detailed CLPX microwave and snow data provide an excellent opportunity to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The ability of electromagnetic models to accurately predict microwave emission of a snowpack is complicated by the need to account for, among other things, nonindependent scattering by closely packed snow grains, stratigraphic variations, and the occurrence of wet snow. A multilayer dense medium model can account for the first two effects. While microwave remote sensing is well known to be capable of binary wet/dry discrimination, the ability to model brightness as a function of wetness opens up the possibility of ultimately retrieving a percentage wetness value during such hydrologically significant melting conditions. In this paper, the first application of a multilayer dense medium radiative transfer theory (DMRT) model is proposed to simulate emission from both wet and dry snow during melting and refreezing cycles. Wet snow is modeled as a mixture of ice particles surrounded by a thin film of water embedded in an air background. Melting/ refreezing cycles are studied by means of brightness temperatures at 6.7, 19, and 37 GHz recorded by the University of Michigan Truck-Mounted Radiometer System at the Local Scale Observation Site during the Cold Land Processes Experiment-1 in March 2003. Input parameters to the DMRT model are obtained from snow pit measurements carried out in conjunction with the microwave observations. The comparisons between simulated and measured brightness temperatures show that the electromagnetic model is able to reproduce the brightness temperatures with an average percentage error of 3\% (similar to 8 K) and a maximum relative percentage error of around 8\% (similar to 20 K).},

	abstract = {The local scale observation site (LSOS) is the smallest study site (0.8 ha) of the 2002/03 Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) and is located within the Fraser mesocell study area. It was the most intensively measured site of the CLPX, and measurements here had the greatest temporal component of all CLPX sites. Measurements made at the LSOS were designed to produce a comprehensive assessment of the snow, soil, and vegetation characteristics viewed by the ground-based remote sensing instruments. The objective of the ground-based microwave remote sensing was to collect time series of active and passive microwave spectral signatures over snow, soil, and forest, which is coincident with the intensive physical characterization of these features. Ground-based remote sensing instruments included frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars operating over multiple microwave bandwidths; the Ground-Based Microwave Radiometer (GBMR-7) operating at channels 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89 GHz; and in 2003, an L-, C-, X- and Ku-band scatterometer radar system. Snow and soil measurements included standard snow physical properties, snow wetness, snow depth transects, and soil moisture. The stem and canopy temperature and xylem sap flux of several trees were monitored continuously. Five micrometeorological towers monitored ambient conditions and provided forcing datasets for 1D snow and soil models. Arrays of pyranometers (0.3-3 mu m) and a scanning thermal radiometer (8-12 mu m) characterized the variability of radiative receipt in the forests. A field spectroradiometer measured the hyperspectral hemispherical-directional reflectance of the snow surface. These measurements, together with the ground-based remote sensing, provide the framework for evaluating and improving microwave radiative transfer models and coupling them to land surface models. The dataset is archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado.},

First, the setup and the mode of operation of the scatterometers are discussed, Both instruments measure the back-scattering coefficients gamma at hh, vv, vh, and vh polarizations and for incidence angles ranging from 0 to 70 degrees, The accuracy of gamma is generally better than +/-1.8 dB, and the scatterometers are well suited for signature studies of natural surfaces. During the two gears, we performed many backscattering measurements of natural, strongly layered snowcovers and we investigated relationships between gamma and physical parameters of the snowcover. All measurements were collected in a signature catalogue. Here we report on results at 40 degrees incidence angle, me found that the combined use of active sensors at 5.3 and 35 GHz allows the discrimination of various snowcover situations, if multitemporal information is available. In addition, we observed a relationship of gamma at 5.3 GHz with the integrated colunm height of liquid water and dependencies of gamma at 35 GHz on the height of the dry snow, on the volumetric liquid water content at the snow surface, and on the thickness of the refrozen crust at the snow surface.},

	abstract = {Surface-based microwave studies made in the Austrian Alps during the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) experiment in April 1994 are described, and are compared with the SAR data. The SAR test region included glaciers and unglaciated surfaces which were snow covered. Clear differences between these two surface types were observed with the SIR-C/X-SAR. In addition, the angular dependencies of the backscattering were useful in order to distinguish between the accumulation and the ablation areas of the glaciers, and the snow-covered areas showed characteristic differences depending on the presence or absence of layers containing wet snow.

The surface-based studies were carried out at an alpine meadow in the valley Kaunertal at an altitude of 2160 m. The measurements included snow-physical observations supported by microwave dielectric probes, microwave radiometers at 21 and 35 GHz and polarimetric scatterometers at 5.3 and 35 GHz. The dielectric measurements were used to retrieve the liquid-water profile of the snowpack. Three main layers were observed: a wet bottom layer as a remnant of a warm period in March, a thick crust (i.e., the refrozen part of the old pack), and a fresh and mostly dry snow layer on top. Except for the top layer, the temporal changes were small during the observation period from 8 to 12 April 1994. The radiometric measurements made at 21 and 35 GHz showed pronounced temporal variations of the brightness temperature in the afternoons due to melt-and-refreeze cycles in the fresh snow. The liquid water in the top layer was monitored by a special radiometric method using a metal plate at the bottom of this layer. The radiometer and scatterometer measurements revealed the refrozen crust as the dominant scatterer, especially at 35 GHz. However, the wet bottom layer inhibited the detection of signals scattered at the snow-ground interface and therefore reduced the backscatter at 5.3 GHz.

The comparison of the C-band SAR data with those of the C-band scatterometer shows higher returns in the SAR data for the considered test site. Explanations for the differences are discussed. Nevertheless, also the SAR backscatter data are clearly lower in the zones where wet snow was present than in areas either covered by dry snow or which were snow-free.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the surface and internal layer geometry from ice-penetrating radar and global positioning system surveys on three inter-ice-stream ridges in West Antarctica (Siple Dome, ridge DE and ridge BC) are examined with ice-flow models to infer (1) the history of the divide position at each site and (2) the spatial pattern of accumulation across the ridges. We find that the divide position is most steady at Siple Dome, somewhat steady at ridge DE and highly variable at ridge BC. Data from Siple Dome and ridge DE show evidence for steady northward motion of the ice divide for the past few thousand years. The layers beneath ridge BC suggest a 5 km northward shift of the divide position within the past several hundred years. Assuming the divide shifts are all due to changing elevation of the bounding ice streams, we infer the relative elevation history for segments of Ice Streams B-E. The northward displacement of the divide for all ridges implies a progressive relative thinning of the ice streams from E to B, with most dramatic recent thinning (100 in in < 10(3) years) of Ice Stream B relative to Ice Stream C. Analysis of the internal layer pattern across the ridges indicates a south-north accumulation gradient with higher accumulation rates on the northern flanks of the ridges in all three cases. The inferred accumulation distribution is nearly uniform on the northern flanks, decreases sharply within a few ice thicknesses across the divides, and then decreases gradually farther to the south. The north/south decrease is strongest for ridge DE and weakest for ridge BC. This spatial pattern and the reduction in gradient strength with distance from the Amundsen Sea is consistent with the hypothesis that storms from the Amundsen Sea carry moisture first south then west over West Antarctica and deposit more snow on the windward side of ridges due to orographic lifting. This pattern has been stable for at least the past several thousand years.},

	abstract = {The spatial pattern of accumulation rate can be inferred from internal layers in glaciers and ice sheets. Non-dimensional analysis determines where finite strain can be neglected ('shallow-layer approximation') or approximated with a local one-dimensional flow model ('local-layer approximation'), and where gradients in strain rate along particle paths must be included ('deep layers'). We develop a general geophysical inverse procedure to infer the spatial pattern of accumulation rate along a steady-state flowband, using measured topography of the ice-sheet surface, bed and a 'deep layer'. A variety of thermomechanical ice-flow models can be used in the forward problem to calculate surface topography and ice velocity, which are used to calculate particle paths and internal-layer shapes. An objective tolerance criterion prevents over-fitting the data. After making site-specific simplifications in the thermomechanical flow algorithm, we find the accumulation rate along a flowband through Taylor Mouth, a flank site on Taylor Dome, Antarctica, using a layer at approximately 100 m depth, or 20\% of the ice thickness. Accumulation rate correlates with ice-surface curvature. At this site, gradients along flow paths critically impact inference of both the accumulation pattern, and the depth-age relation in a 100 m core.},

	abstract = {Airborne radar sounding over the Thwaites Glacier (TG) catchment and its surroundings provides the first comprehensive view of subglacial topography in this dynamic part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and reveals that TG is underlain by a single, broad basin fed by a dendritic pattern of valleys, while Smith Glacier lies within an extremely deep, narrow trench. Subglacial topography in the TG catchment slopes inland from a broad, low-relief coastal sill to the thickest ice of the WAIS and makes deep connections to both Pine Island Glacier and the Ross Sea Embayment enabling dynamic interactions across the WAIS during deglaciation. Simple isostatic rebound modeling shows that most of this landscape would be submarine after deglaciation, aside from an island chain near the present-day Ross-Amundsen ice divide. The lack of topographic confinement along TG's eastern margin implies that it may continue to widen in response to grounding line retreat.},

	abstract = {Rutford Ice Stream and Carlson Inlet are neighbouring glaciers in West Antarctica. Rutford Ice Stream flows at speeds greater than 350m a(-1), whereas Carlson Inlet, which has some similar dimensions and supports a similar driving stress, flows 10-50 times slower. We discuss a range of observations concerning Carlson Inlet, and conclude that there is good indirect evidence that it is a relict ice stream, which ceased streaming more than 240 years BP, but sufficiently recently that its surface morphology, basal water content and basal morphology still retain characteristics produced by streaming. An analysis of expected subglacial drainage pathways indicates that Carlson Inlet is not streaming because it is currently starved of subglacial water, which is currently directed beneath Rutford Ice Stream. This current state of water piracy by Rutford Ice Stream is, however, sensitive to minor thickness changes on the ice streams; a similar to 120 m (<4\%) thickening of Rutford Ice Stream would divert almost all the subglacial water in the system towards Carlson Inlet and could reactivate its flow. The result highlights the importance of subglacial drainage in controlling ice-stream evolution and the requirement for ice-sheet models to couple ice flow with subglacial drainage.},

	abstract = {Researchers and practitioners have long utilized a variety of penetrometers to investigate the snowpack. Identifying definitive relationships between penetrometer-derived microstructural information and stability has been challenging. The purpose of this study is two-fold: 1. We propose a simple field test to establish relationships between load and penetrometer-derived microstructural estimates. 2. We utilize the SnowMicroPen (SMP) to quantify changes in weak layer residual strength and microstructural dimension associated with an artificial loading event Our dataset is from Moonlight Basin, Montana and includes three modified loaded-column tests, each paired with 5 SMP profiles. Depth hoar comprised the targeted weak layer. Results indicate that loading caused the residual strength and rupture frequency to decrease significantly. Much like a compression test at a micro-scale, the force required for the SMP to rupture individual structures as well as the micro-scale strength decreased significantly when the slab stress was increased by artificially adding blocks of snow. A decrease in observed rupture frequency within the weak layer (or an increase in the distance between ruptured structures) also occurred after the loading event. probably because some structures within the weak layer had already failed or were so close to failing that the penetrometer could not detect their rupture. Due in part to the large difference in loads, microstructural differences between the natural and loaded columns were significant enough that only one profile would have been necessary to determine a significant difference in residual strength. Artificial removal of slab stress resulted in greater rupture forces and larger microstructures, likely due to elastic rebound. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The texture of snow has a great impact on the mechanical and thermal properties of a snowpack. The texture index (TI) is a new concept to quantify the texture of snow at the micro- and mesoscale, a scale at which the properties of snow layers are responsible for the stability of a snowpack. It is calculated by taking the ratio of mean grain-size (mm) of snow to density (kg m(-3)) of snow in a given layer. It combines a microstructural with a mesostructural parameter. An empirically derived TI is compared with a simulated TI for laboratory experimental snow and natural snow profiles. The TI was calculated throughout the development of three temperature-gradient snow experiments from laboratory measurements of grain-size and density. In a one-dimensional finite-element snowpack model (SNOWPACK), the development of the mean grain-size and density of these snow samples was simulated. It can be shown that the measured TI can be predicted by the modelled TI. Furthermore, three natural snow profiles from the Weissfluhjoch (Switzerland) test-field are compared with their simulations in terms of TI. This comparison reveals shortcomings in the measurement of fundamental parameters. It also shows the dependency of a good physical model on quantitative process descriptions at the microscale. The TI can be estimated using the force signal of the SnowMicroPen, a new high-resolution snow micropenetrometer. It is suggested that more accurate classical measurements combined with penetrometer measurements in the immediate vicinity of the snow profile will allow better verification of SNOWPACK simulations.},

In snow and ice, the fast neutrons lose energy by scattering from hydrogen atoms, and the number of slow neutrons arriving at the detector (the Count rate) is related to the density of the medium. Calibration equations for count rate as a function of snow density and borehole diameter have been derived. Snow-density profiles from boreholes obtained using the probe show that, despite the smoothing produced by the neutron-scattering process, annual variations in density call be resolved. The potential contribution of the neutron probe to improvements in mass-balance monitoring is discussed.},

	abstract = {We have developed a technique in which we use a borehole video camera and post-processing software to make a record of the optical brightness as a function of depth in polar firn. We call this method borehole optical stratigraphy. To measure firn compaction, we note the positions of optical features on the borehole wall detected by an initial 'baseline' log. We track the displacements of these features in subsequent logs. The result provides a measurement of the relative vertical motion and thus compaction of the firn over the survey period. We have successfully used this system at Summit, Greenland, to measure the depth distribution of firn column shortening experienced in a borehole over three 1 year periods. The uppermost 30 m of the firn at Summit is compacting as predicted by a simple steady-state model, implying that the firn density profile at Summit is at or close to steady state over the past similar to 70 years.},

We also used three different techniques for determining density to convert annual-layer thickness to accumulation: (1) gravimetric measurements on core samples, (2) measurement of density using NP and (3) a simple empirical model based on regional climatology. The result is nine different accumulation time series, three of which are completely independent. The chemical-analysis- and NP-derived accumulation time series are correlated, and the similar to 70 year means are in agreement. The BOS-derived accumulation similar to 70 year mean is slightly lower, probably due to a combination of the empirical density model's underestimate of the density profile and the misidentification of sub-annual events in the shallow part of the borehole as annual horizons.},

We also used a neutron-scattering probe (NP) to measure a density profile in the borehole from which the core was extracted. The NP- and DEP-derived density profiles were similar, showing largescale (>30cm) variation in the gravimetric densities of each core section. Fine-scale features (<10cm) are well characterized by the COS record and are seen at a slightly lower resolution in both the DEP and NP records, which show increasing smoothing. A combination of the density accuracy of NP and the spatial resolution of COS provides a useful method of evaluating the shallow-density profile of a glacier, improving paleoclimate interpretation, mass-balance measurement and interpretation of radar returns.},

The BOS logs show strong positive correlation at shallow depths with neutron-scattering logs taken in the same borehole. This supports the hypothesis that ROS detects changes in density. The positive correlation between returned brightness and density decreases with depth and finally becomes negative. We conclude this inversion of correlation is related to changes in densification regime from grain-boundary sliding to pressure sintering.},

One system uses a metal-detecting tuned coil, and the other uses a video camera to locate the markers. We compare the merits of the two systems. We combine steady-state calculations and a measured density profile to estimate the true vertical-velocity profile. This allows us to calculate a depth-age scale for the firn at Siple Dome. Our steady-state depth-age scale has ages 10-15\% younger at any given depth when compared to depth-age scales derived by layer counting in a core 40 m away. The age of a visible ash layer at 97 m in the core is 665 30 years, in agreement with a similar analysis conducted at Taylor Dome, Antarctica, where the same ash is also seen, providing an additional dated tie point between the two cores.},

	abstract = {The specific surface area (SSA) of snow determines in part the albedo of snow surfaces and the capacity of the snow to adsorb chemical species and catalyze reactions. Despite these crucial roles, almost no value of snow SSA are available for the largest permanent snow expanse on Earth, the Antarctic. We report the first extensive study of vertical profiles of snow SSA near Dome C (DC: 75 degrees 06' S, 123 degrees 20' E, 3233 m a.s.l.) on the Antarctic plateau, and at seven sites during the logistical traverse between Dome C and the French coastal base Dumont D'Urville (DDU: 66 degrees 40' S, 140 degrees 01' E) during the Austral summer 2008-2009. We used the DU-FISSS system, which measures the IR reflectance of snow at 1310 nm with an integrating sphere. At DC, the mean SSA of the snow in the top 1 cm is 38 m(2) kg(-1), decreasing monotonically to 14 m(2) kg(-1) at a depth of 50 cm. Along the traverse, the snow SSA profile is similar to that at DC in the first 600 km from DC. Closer to DDU, the SSA of the top 5 cm is 23 m(2) kg(-1), decreasing to 19 m(2) kg(-1) at 50 cm depth. This difference is attributed to wind, which causes a rapid decrease of surface snow SSA, but forms hard wind-packs whose SSA decrease more slowly with time. Since light-absorbing impurities are not concentrated enough to affect albedo, the vertical profiles of SSA and density were used to calculate the spectral albedo of the snow for several realistic illumination conditions, using the DISORT radiative transfer model. A preliminary comparison with MODIS data is presented and our calculations and MODIS data show similar trends.},

	abstract = {We present a technique for in situ measurement of the vertical and spatial stratigraphic distribution of snow optical grain size with a coupled contact illumination probe and field spectroradiometer. Accurate measurements of optical-equivalent grain size are critical for modeling radiative properties of snow such as spectral albedo and microwave emission. Measurements of the spectral reflectance of the snow-pit surface are made at 2 cm intervals in the vertical plane under constant illumination and view geometries. We invert the integral of the continuum normalization of the ice absorption feature with maximum at 1.03 mu m wavelength for optical-equivalent grain size using the validated model of Nolin and Dozier (2000) that has accuracy of +/- 10-50 mu m across the grain-size range 50-900 mu m. Results are presented for an alpine site in southwest Colorado, USA, across the ablation season and for a Greenland ice-sheet site at the onset of snowmelt. These results suggest that traditional measurements of grain size using a hand lens are nearly accurate only for rounded grains (R-2 = 0.41, rmse = 160 mu m); for polycrystals and faceted grains the hand-lens approach is very inaccurate (R-2 = 0.03 and 0.24, rmse = 1206 and 1010 mu m, respectively). We demonstrate an order-of-magnitude improvement in modeling of shortwave spectral albedo and net shortwave flux with contact spectroscopy measurements of grain-size stratigraphy over those from a hand lens.},

Calibrated NI R photography allows quantitative determination of SSA and its spatial variation in a snow profile in two dimensions within an uncertainty of 15\%. In an image covering 0.5-1.0 m(2), even layers of I mm thickness can be documented and measured. Spatial maps of SSA are an important tool in initializing and validating physical and chemical models of the snowpack.},

	abstract = {We present a microstructural characterization of fine-grained layers from the top 90 m of firn from Summit, Greenland, performed using a combination of scanning electron microscopy techniques including secondary electron imaging, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and electron backscattered patterns, and X-ray microcomputed tomography. The impurities in the firn, both soluble impurities and dust particles, were found largely in the grain interiors. Both c- and a-axis pole figures do not show strong evidence of a preferred orientation of the grains even at the bottom of the firn column. The firn structure became increasingly anisotropic with vertical alignment in the top 3 m, probably due to vapor transport associated with dry-snow metamorphism. The anisotropy decreases below this level until at similar to 50 m the average firn structure is close to isotropic. In the near surface, the level of anisotropy is weaker than at Hercules Dome, Antarctica, confirming that differences in accumulation rates and temperatures leave enduring evidence in the structure of the firn. The fraction of closed-off pores is relatively low until similar to 65 m; below that it rises through the end of our sampling at 90 m. Our microstructure measurements on the microscale are consistent with in situ firn-air sampling measurements on a decimeter scale, both indicating the existence of the lock-in zone starting near 69 m depth, and pore close-off at 81 m at this site.},

	abstract = {The relation between heat flow through snow and microstructure is crucial for the comprehension and modeling of thermophysical, chemical, and mechanical properties of snow. This relationship was investigated using heat flux measurements combined with a microstructural numerical approach. A snow sample was subjected to a temperature gradient and the passing heat flux was measured. Simultaneously, the snow microstructure was imaged by X-ray micro-tomography. The heat flow through the observed ice matrix and its heat conductivity was computed by a finite element method. Comparison of measured and simulated heat conductivities suggests that heat conduction through the ice matrix is predominant. The representative elementary volume with respect to density and heat conductivity as well as the tortuosity factor of the ice matrix was determined. In contrast to the density, the tortuosity factor takes into account the relevant geometry of the ice matrix and has many advantages in heat transfer models.},

	abstract = {Temperature gradient metamorphism is one of the dominant processes changing the structure of natural dry snow. The structure of snow regulates the thermal and mechanical properties. Physical models and numerical simulations of the evolution of the snow cover require a thorough understanding of the interplay between structure and physical properties. The structure of snow and the heat conductivity were measured simultaneously without disturbance in a miniature snow breeder. The structure was measured by microtomography, and heat conductivity by measuring heat fluxes and temperatures. A temperature gradient from 25 to 100 K m(-1) was applied to the snow. The snow density range of the samples varied from 150 to 500 kg m(-3). The density in the observed volume remained constant during the experiments under temperature gradient conditions. The structure was analysed with respect to the size of typical ice structures and air pores, specific surface area, curvature and anisotropy of the ice matrix. The temporal changes in structure and heat conductivity are compared. The heat conductivity changed by as much as twice its initial value, caused by changes in structure and texture, but not due to changes in density. This shows the enormous importance of structure in the evolution of the heat conductivity. The observed changes are not in good agreement with the current understanding of the metamorphic process, because beat conductivity increased during temperature gradient metamorphism, instead of the expected decrease due to a shrinking of the bonds. We also observed a plateau in the evolution of the heat conductivity coefficient, which indicates a quasi-steady state of the structural evolution with respect to thermophysical proper-ties of snow.

	abstract = {The snow surface roughness at centimetre and millimetre scales is an important parameter related to wind transport, snowdrifts, snowfall, snowmelt and snow grain size. Knowledge of the snow surface roughness is also of high interest for analyzing the signal from radar sensors such as SAR, altimeters and scatterometers. Unfortunately, this parameter has seldom been measured over snow surfaces. The techniques used to measure the roughness of other surfaces, such as agricultural or sand soils, are difficult to implement in polar regions because of the harsh climatic conditions. In this paper we develop a device based on a laser profiler coupled with a GPS receiver on board a snowmobile. This instrumentation was tested successfully in midre Lovenbreen, Svalbard, in April 2006. It allowed us to generate profiles of 3 km sections of the snow-covered glacier surface. Because of the motion of the snowmobile, the roughness signal is mixed with the snowmobile signal. We use a distance/frequency analysis (the empirical mode decomposition) to filter the signal. This method allows us to recover the snow surface structures of wavelengths between 4 and 50 cm with amplitudes of >1 mm. Finally, the roughness parameters of snow surfaces are retrieved. The snow surface roughness is found to be dependent on the scales of the observations. The retrieved RMS of the height distribution is found to vary between 0.5 and 9.2 mm, and the correlation length is found to be between 0.6 and 46 cm. This range of measurements is particularly well adapted to the analysis of GHz radar response on snow surfaces.},

	abstract = {Air-snow transfer processes impact both ice-core interpretation and exchange affecting atmospheric chemistry. An understanding of seasonal differences in the character of the surface snow will facilitate evaluation of possible preferential seasonal exchange of reactive chemical species. Both diffusive processes and advective (ventilation) processes can serve to alter the physical, chemical and isotopic character of snow and firn. In this paper, we examine measurements of surface roughness over the course of a year at Summit, Greenland, and the implications for snow and firn ventilation. At Summit, during the winter-over experiment, summer and fall sastrugi amplitudes were approximately 5 cm and had smoothly curved profiles. The average amplitudes experienced mild increases in january, but by the end of February through March the amplitude increased to approximately 20 cm, and the profiles exhibited more abrupt geometries. Calculations are performed to show the potential impact of the changing roughness on interstitial ventilation rates in the snow, assuming that the permeability profile does not change in 1 time. Under high winds, ventilation velocities in the near-surface snow can be up to 3 cm s(-1) in the winter, compared to 1 cm s(-1) in the summer. The frequency of 12 m s(-1) winds in the summer, however, is less than in the winter. Under low-wind conditions, the summer roughness causes ventilation rates that are comparable to diffusion rates. However, in winter even 5 cm s(-1) wind conditions can cause the interstitial airflow due to ventilation to exceed the diffusion rates.},

	abstract = {Fast-flowing ice streams transport ice from the interior of West Antarctica to the ocean, and fluctuations in their activity control the mass balance of the ice sheet. The mass balance of the Ross Sea sector of the West Antarctic ice sheet is now positive-that is, it is growing-mainly because one of the ice streams (ice stream C) slowed down about 150 years ago(1). Here we present evidence from both surface measurements and remote sensing that demonstrates the highly dynamic nature of the Ross drainage system. We show that the flow in an area that once discharged into ice stream C has changed direction, now draining into the Whillans ice stream (formerly ice stream B). This switch in flow direction is a result of continuing thinning of the Whillans ice stream and recent thickening of ice stream C. Further abrupt reorganization of the activity and configuration of the ice streams over short timescales is to be expected in the future as the surface topography of the ice sheet responds to the combined effects of internal dynamics and long-term climate change. We suggest that caution is needed when using observations of short-term mass changes to draw conclusions about the large-scale mass balance of the ice sheet.},

	abstract = {We present a first assessment of airborne laser and radar altimeter data over snow-covered sea ice, gathered during the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Operation IceBridge Mission. We describe a new technique designed to process radar echograms fromthe University of Kansas snow radar to estimate snow depth. We combine IceBridge laser altimetry with radar-derived snow depths to determine sea ice thickness. Results are validated through comparison with direct measurements of snow and ice thickness collected in situ at the Danish GreenArc 2009 sea ice camp located on fast ice north of Greenland. The IceBridge instrument suite provides accurate measurements of snow and ice thickness, particularly over level ice. Mean IceBridge snow and ice thickness agree with in situ measurements to within similar to 0.01 and similar to 0.05 m, respectively, while modal snow and ice thickness estimates agree to within 0.02 and 0.10 m, respectively. IceBridge snow depths were correlated with in situ measurements (R = 0.7, for an averaging length of 55 m). The uncertainty associated with the derived IceBridge sea ice thickness estimates is 0.40 m. The results demonstrate the retrieval of both first-year and multiyear ice thickness from IceBridge data. The airborne data were however compromised in heavily ridged ice where snow depth, and hence ice thickness, could not be measured. Techniques developed as part of this study will be used for routine processing of IceBridge retrievals over Arctic sea ice. The limitations of the GreenArc study are discussed, and recommendations for future validation of airborne measurements via field activities are provided.},

The manual measurements confirmed that unaltered digital images accurately represented a two-dimensional roughness profile of the snowpack surface. Roughness indices, such as random roughness, that have been used to represent soil surfaces were computed, and their utility for quantifying snowpack surface roughness is illustrated. Variogram analysis was used to determine the fractal dimension and scale break. Surface characteristics were a function of the scale, with a rough snow surface and graupe1 yielding similar results. A relatively smooth snow surface showed no crystal-scale features and had a fractal dimension approaching that of a random surface.},

	abstract = {The resolution of snow depth measurements was scaled from a nominal horizontal resolution of approximately 1.5 m to 3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 m using averaging (AVG) and resampling with a uniform random stratified sampling (RSS) scheme. The raw snow depth values were Computed from airborne light detection and ranging data by differencing summer elevation measurements from winter snow surface elevations. Three montane study sites from the NASA Cold Lands Processes Experiment, each covering an 1100 in x 1100 m area, were used.

To examine scaling, log-log semi-variograms with 50 log-width bins were created for both of the different subsetting methods, i.e. RSS and AVG. From the raw data, a scale break, going from a structured to a nearly spatially random system, was observed in each of the log-log variograms. For each site, the scale break was still detectable at slightly greater than the resampling resolution for the RSS scheme, but at approximately twice the subsetting resolution for the AVG scheme. The resolution required to identify the scale break was still from 5 to 10 m, depending upon the location and sampling method. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Fractal dimensions derived from log-log variograms are useful for characterizing spatial structure and scaling behavior in snow depth distributions. This study examines the temporal consistency of snow depth scaling features at two sites using snow depth distributions derived from lidar datasets collected in 2003 and 2005. The temporal snow accumulation patterns in these two years were substantially different, but both years represent nearly average 1 April accumulation depths for these sites, with consistent statistical distributions. Two distinct fractal regions are observed in each log-log variogram, separated by a scale break, which indicates a length scale at which a substantial change in the driving processes exists. The lag distance of the scale break is 15 m at the Walton Creek site and 40 m at the Alpine site. The datasets show consistent fractal dimensions and scale break distances between the two years, suggesting that the scaling features observed in spatial snow depth distributions are largely determined by physiography and vegetation characteristics and are relatively insensitive to annual variations in snowfall. Directional variograms also show consistent patterns between years, with smaller fractal dimensions aligned with the dominant wind direction at each site.},

	abstract = {This paper reports oil a study analysing the spatial distribution functions, the correlation structures, and the power spectral densities of high-resolution LIDAR snow depths (similar to 1 m) in two adjacent 500 m x 500 in areas in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, one a sub-alpine forest the other in alpine tundra. It is shown how and why differences in the controlling physical processes induced by variations in vegetation cover and wind patterns lead to the observed differences in spatial organization between the snow depth fields of these environments. In the sub-alpine forest area, the mean of snow depth increases with elevation, while its standard deviation remains uniform. fit the tundra subarea. the mean of snow depth decreases with elevation, while its standard deviation varies over a wide range. The two-dimensional correlations of snow depth in the forested area indicate little spatial memory and isotropic conditions. while in the tundra they indicate a marked directional bias that is consistent with the predominant wind directions and the location of topographic ridges and depressions. The power spectral densities exhibit a power law behaviour in two frequency intervals separated by a break located at a scale of around 12 m in the forested subarea, and 65 m in the tundra subarea. The spectral exponents obtained indicate that the snow depth fields are highly variable over scales larger than the scale break, while highly correlated below. Based on the observations and oil synthetic snow depth fields generated with one- and two-dimensional spectral techniques, it is shown that the scale at which the break occurs increases with the separation distance between snow depth maxima. In addition, the breaks in the forested area coincide with those of the corresponding vegetation height field, while in the tundra subarea they are displaced towards larger scales than those observed in the corresponding vegetation height field.

	abstract = {In this study, LIDAR snow depths, bare ground elevations (topography), and elevations filtered to the top of vegetation (topography + vegetation) in five 1- km(2) areas are used to determine whether the spatial distribution of snow depth exhibits scale invariance, and the control that vegetation, topography, and winds exert on such behavior. The one- dimensional and mean two- dimensional power spectra of snow depth exhibit power law behavior in two frequency intervals separated by a scale break located between 7 m and 45 m. The spectral exponents for the low- frequency range vary between 0.1 and 1.2 for the one- dimensional spectra, and between 1.3 and 2.2 for the mean two-dimensional power spectra. The spectral exponents for the high- frequency range vary between 3.3 and 3.6 for the one- dimensional spectra, and between 4.0 and 4.5 for the mean two- dimensional spectra. Such spectral exponents indicate the existence of two distinct scaling regimes, with significantly larger variations occurring in the larger- scale regime. Similar bilinear power law spectra were obtained for the fields of vegetation height, with crossover wavelengths between 7 m and 14 m. Further analysis of the snow depth and vegetation fields, together with wind data, support the conclusion that the break in the scaling behavior of snow depth is controlled by the scaling characteristics of the spatial distribution of vegetation height when snow redistribution by wind is minimal and canopy interception is dominant, and by the interaction of winds with features such as surface concavities and vegetation when snow redistribution by wind is dominant.},

	abstract = {Snowpack properties vary dramatically over a wide range of spatial scales, from crystal microstructure to regional snow climates. The driving forces of wind, energy balance, and precipitation interact with topography and vegetation to dominate snow depth variability at horizontal scales from 1 to 1000 m. This study uses land surface elevation, vegetation surface elevation, and snow depth data measured using airborne lidar at three sites in north-central Colorado. Fractal dimensions are estimated from the slope of a log-transformed variogram and demonstrate scale-invariant, fractal behavior in the elevation, vegetation, and snow depth datasets. Snow depth and vegetation topography each show two distinct fractal distributions over different scale ranges (multifractal behavior), with short-range fractal dimensions near 2.5 and long-range fractal dimensions around 2.9 at all locations. These fractal ranges are separated by a scale break at 15-40 m, depending on the site, which indicates a process change at that scale. Terrain has a fractal distribution over nearly the entire range of scales available in the data. Directional differences in the fractal dimensions for each parameter are also present at multiple scales, and are related to the wind direction frequency distributions at each site. The results indicate that different sampling resolutions may yield different results and allow rescaling in specific scale ranges. Resolutions of 10 m and finer are consistently self-similar, as are resolutions greater than 30 m, though the coarser resolutions show nearly random distributions.},

	abstract = {Massive glacier thinning in the Alps during the past 20 years is documented by direct mass balance measurements on nine regularly observed glaciers. How representative this limited sample of glaciers is for the entire Alps, however, remained uncertain. The near-global digital terrain model from the SRTM enables a closer analysis of this question, which is of fundamental importance to assess overall glacier volume change. Here we present elevation changes from 1985 to 1999 for about 1050 glaciers in the Swiss Alps. The analysis reveals extreme thickness losses (>80 m) for flat/low-lying glacier tongues and a strong overall surface lowering. The mean cumulative mass balance of the nine glaciers with direct measurements (-10.8 m w.e.) agrees well with the mean change of the entire region from DEM differencing (-11 m w.e.) and can thus be considered to be representative. Mean thickness change of individual glaciers is correlated with their size, elevation, and exposure to solar irradiation. This implies that mass losses of large glaciers can be underestimated when they are directly inferred from values measured at much smaller glaciers. Citation: Paul, F., and W.

	abstract = {[1] The digital elevation model (DEM) from the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was differenced from a composite DEM based on air photos dating from 1948 to 1987 to determine glacier volume changes in southeast Alaska and adjoining Canada. SRTM accuracy was assessed at +/- 5 m through comparison with airborne laser altimetry and control locations measured with GPS. Glacier surface elevations lowered over 95\% of the 14,580 km(2) glacier-covered area analyzed, with some glaciers thinning as much as 640 m. A combination of factors have contributed to this wastage, including calving retreats of tidewater and lacustrine glaciers and climate change. Many glaciers in this region are particularly sensitive to climate change, as they have large areas at low elevations. However, several tidewater glaciers that had historically undergone calving retreats are now expanding and appear to be in the advancing stage of the tidewater glacier cycle. The net average rate of ice loss is estimated at 16.7 +/- 4.4 km(3)/yr, equivalent to a global sea level rise contribution of 0.04 +/- 0.01 mm/yr.},

	abstract = {The ability to measure velocities of fast-moving glaciers is essential to the understanding and interpretation of their dynamics and related processes. This is especially important in the Jakobshavn drainage basin of the Greenland ice sheet, where a significant portion of the ice sheet mass loss occurs and the iceberg calving rate is high. In this article, zee present a method for using airborne laser altimetry data to determine surface velocities in portions of the Jakobshavn drainage basin that have distinct elevation features. By examining correlations between repeat elevation surveys, the motion of these features, the most distinct of which are crevasses, is tracked. Results show that for areas with a standard deviation in elevation in excess of 1 m, displacement of features can be tracked to a precision of 1-2 m, and the corresponding velocities can be retrieved. The maximum velocity of the Jakobshavn Isbrae, at its calving front, is found to be nearly 7 km yr(-1). Ice stream boundaries and flow patterns can also be observed in the derived velocity data.

Their combined rate of mass loss doubled in less than a year in 2004 and then decreased in 2006 to near the previous rates, likely as a result of fast re-equilibration of calving-front geometry after retreat. Total mass loss is a fraction of concurrent gravity-derived estimates, pointing to an alternative source of loss and the need for high-resolution observations of outlet dynamics and glacier geometry for sea-level rise predictions.},

This radar technology provides a promising alternative to point measurements, as properties such as snow depth can be measured quickly and non-destructively. Recent advances in microwave FMCW radar technology have resulted in lightweight, portable instrumentation. This is in contrast to the early FMCW radar systems which were often too heavy to cover large distances efficiently. These advanced FMCW radars provide snow scientists and hydrologists with the ability to map snow pack properties, such as depth, snow water equivalent (SWE) and stratigraphy, rapidly over large distances, at high resolution. We discuss the development of FMCW radar over the past 30 years and review the diverse applications of these radars by snow scientists. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, relatively high attenuation of radio waves by dielectric absorption and volume scattering from englacial water hampers detection of the bed through warm deep ice. In the past we have had success measuring ice thickness of temperate glaciers using a ground-based monopulse radar system operating at low frequencies (2 MHz). Here we adapt the same system to operate from an airplane. Test flights over Bering Glacier, Alaska, USA, detected the bed through ice up to 1250 m thick. Flights across the Seward-Malaspina Glacier system, Alaska, resolved the ice thickness of Malaspina Glacier, but strong hyperbolic-shaped returns obscured the bed echo through the Seward throat. It is likely that this clutter in the signal was caused by off-nadir returns from chaotic surface crevasses that are ubiquitous in the throat region.},

	abstract = {Characteristics of the Ku-band polarimetric scatterometer (POLSCAT) data acquired from five sets of aircraft flights in the winter months of 2006-2008 for the second Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX-II) in Colorado are described in this paper. The data showed the response of the Ku-band radar echoes to snowpack changes for various types of background vegetation in the study site in north central Colorado. We observed about 0.15-0.5-dB increases in backscatter for every 1 cm of snow-water-equivalent (SWE) accumulation for areas with short vegetation (sagebrush and pasture). The region with the smaller amount of biomass, signified by the backscatter in November, seemed to have the stronger backscatter response to SWE in decibels. The data also showed the impact of surface hoar growth and freeze/thaw cycles, which created large snow-grain sizes, ice crust layers, and ice lenses and consequently increased the radar signals by a few decibels. The copolarized HH/VV backscatter ratio seems to indicate double-bounce scattering between the ground surface and snow or vegetation. The cross-polarized backscatter [vertical-horizontal (VH)] showed not only the influence of vegetation but also the strong response to snow accumulation. The observed HV/VV ratio suggests the importance of multiple scattering or nonspherical scattering geometry of snow grain in the dense-media radiative transfer scattering model. Comparison of the POLSCAT and QuikSCAT data was made and confirmed the effects of mixed terrain covers in the coarse-resolution QuikSCAT data.},

	abstract = {Large, late-winter ptarmigan migrations heavily impact the shoot, plant, and patch architecture of shrubs that remain above the snow surface. Ptarmigan browsing on arctic shrubs was assessed in the vicinity of Toolik Lake, on the north side of the Brooks Range in Alaska. Data were collected in early May 2007, at maximum snow depth, after the bulk of the ptarmigan migration had passed through the area. In an area of tall shrubs, half of the buds on Salix alaxensis were browsed by ptarmigan. Three percent of the buds that were buried beneath the snow were browsed, 90\% of the buds that were less than 30 cm above the maximum snow level were browsed, and 45\% of the buds above that height were browsed. Ptarmigan browsing was found to be a major height limiter for tall shrubs, thereby controlling shrub architecture by brooming stems at the snow surface and inducing stump shoots. These results were qualitatively extrapolated by photographing shrub morphology over a region approximately 300 km wide across a series of north-flowing arctic rivers with headwaters in the Brooks Range. Ptarmigan "hedging" of shrub patches, and shrub growth under a warmer climate, are opposing forces mediated by snow distribution.},

A Fuji S9100 digital camera, modified lobe sensitive to NIR wavelengths, was mounted on a rail system that allowed for rapid imaging of a 10 m long snow trench excavated on the north side of Toolik Lake, Alaska (68 degrees 38'N, 149 degrees 36'W). Post-processing of the images included removal of lens distortion and vignetting. A tape measure running along the base of the trench provided known locations (control points) that permitted scaling and georeferencing. Snow layer heights estimated from the NIR images compared well with manual stratigraphic measurements made at 0.2 m intervals along the trench (n = 357, R-2 = 0.97). Considerably greater stratigraphic detail was captured by the NIR images than in the manually recorded profiles. NIR imaging of snow trenches using the described protocols is an efficient tool for quantifying continuous microscale variations in snow layers and associated properties.},

	abstract = {{All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming
   trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the
   atmosphere. In addition to the direct effects on climate-for example,
   on the frequency of heatwaves-this increase in surface temperatures has
   important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in
   regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or
   ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the
   melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any
   changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a
   shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer
   and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not
   sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the
   oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on
   glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the
   consequences of these hydrological changes for future water
   availability-predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in
   some regions-are likely to be severe.}},

	abstract = {{Composite patterns of monthly averaged (1978-2002) satellite passive
   microwave derived snow water equivalent (SWE) data produced using the
   Meteorological Service of Canada land cover sensitive algorithm suite
   contain an interannually consistent and well-defined zone of high SWE
   retrievals (> 100 min) across the northern boreal forest of western
   Canada. Consistently lower SWE retrievals are present across both the
   comparatively dense boreal forest to the south, and open tundra to the
   north. Because of the sparse conventional observing network across this
   region, a dedicated field sampling campaign was conducted during the
   2003/2004 winter season to measure snow properties across these
   landscape zones in northern Manitoba, Canada. Using road and helicopter
   access, snow cover measurements were made along an approximately 500 km
   transect between the communities of Thompson (boreal forest), Gillam
   (sparse northern boreal forest), and Churchill (open tundra) during
   late November 2003, and early March 2004.
   The November 2003 snow survey revealed good agreement between Special
   Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) derived SWE retrievals and in situ
   measurements across the gradient of increasing SWE between Thompson and
   Gillam, and the well defined zone of high SWE values to the north and
   east of Gillam. Further to the north, SSM/I derived SWE retrievals over
   the boreal ecotone and open tundra were consistently lower than the in
   situ measurements. Results of the March survey (at which point mean
   snow depths had increased from approximately 30-60 cm) showed an
   increase in absolute SWE differences between the in situ measurements
   and passive microwave estimates, but relative agreement between the
   datasets remained strong. The same SWE gradient across the boreal
   forest was again captured by both datasets, although tundra retrievals
   remained consistently low. These findings, along with consideration of
   snowpack stratigraphy, density, and the potential influence of tundra
   lakes and ponds on microwave emission and scatter, suggest that
   development of a tundra-specific SWE retrieval algorithm is necessary.
   From a scaling perspective, a large range of SWE values were measured
   on the ground within each satellite footprint, but a comparison of
   frequency histograms showed that a high percentage of satellite
   retrievals (November: 93\%; March: 63\%) fell within 20 mm of the
   median ground measurement. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by

	abstract = {{Merging microwave radiances and modeled estimates of snowpack states in
   a data assimilation scheme is a potential method for snowpack
   characterization. A radiance assimilation scheme for snow requires a
   land surface model (LSM) coupled to a radiative transfer model (RTM).
   In this paper, we explore the degree of model fidelity required in
   order for radiance assimilation to yield benefits for snowpack
   characterization. Specifically, we characterize the uncertainty of
   Microwave Emission Model for Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) radiance
   predictions by quantifying model accuracy and sensitivity to the
   following: 1) the LSM snowpack layering scheme and 2) the properties of
   the snow layers, including melt-refreeze ice layers. MEMLS was
   consistent with the measured brightness temperatures at 18.7 and 36.5
   GHz with a bias (mean absolute error) of -0.1 K (3.1 K) for the
   vertical polarization and 3.4 K (9.3 K) for the horizontal
   polarization. An error in the predictions at horizontal polarization is
   due to uncertainty in ice-layer properties. It was found that in order
   for predicted brightness temperatures from the coupled LSM and RTM to
   be adequate for radiance assimilation purposes, the following must be
   satisfied: 1) the LSM snowpack layering scheme must accurately
   represent the stratigraphic snowpack layers; 2) dynamics of
   melt-refreeze ice layers must be modeled explicitly, and the predicted
   density of melt-refreeze layers must be accurate within +/- 40 kg
   center dot m(-3); and 3) the MEMLS correlation length must be predicted
   within +/- 0.016 mm, or effective optical grain diameter must be
   predicted within +/- 0.045 mm. Recommendations for future field
   measurements are made.}},

	abstract = {Time series of snow covered area (SCA) estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) were merged with a spatially explicit snowmelt model to reconstruct snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Rio Grande headwaters (3419 kin). A linear optimization scheme was used to derive SCA estimates that preserve the statistical moments of the higher spatial resolution (i.e. 30 m) ETM+ data and resolve the superior temporal signal (i.e. similar to daily) of the MODIS data. It was found that merging the two SCA products led to an 8% decrease and an 18% increase in the basinwide SWE in 2001 and 2002, respectively, compared to the SWE estimated from ETM+ only. Relative to SWE simulations using only ETM+ data, the hybrid SCA estimates reduced the mean absolute SWE error by 17 and 84% in 2001 and 2002, respectively; errors were determined using intensive snow survey data and two separate methods of scaling snow survey field measurements of SWE to the 1-km model pixel resolution. SWE bias for both years was reduced by 49% and skewness was reduced from -0.78 to 0.49. These results indicate that the hybrid SWE was closer to being an unbiased estimate of the measured SWE and errors were distributed more normally. The accuracy of the SCA estimates is likely dependent on the vegetation fraction. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

   participating in the second phase of the Atmospheric Model
   Intercomparison Project (AMIP-2) are evaluated for their ability to
   simulate the observed spatial and temporal variability in snow mass, or
   water equivalent (SWE), over North America during the AMIP-2 period
   (1979-95). The evaluation is based on a new gridded SWE dataset
   developed from objective analysis of daily snow depth observations from
   Canada and the United States with snow density estimated from a simple
   snowpack model. Most AMIP-2 models simulate the seasonal timing and the
   relative spatial patterns of continental-scale SWE fairly well.
   However, there is a tendency to overestimate the rate of ablation
   during spring, and significant between-model variability is found in
   every aspect of the simulations, and at every spatial scale analyzed.
   For example, on the continental scale, the peak monthly SWE integrated
   over the North American continent in AMIP-2 models varies between +/-
   50\% of the observed value of similar to 1500 km(3). The volume of
   water in the snowpack, and the magnitudes of model errors, are
   significant in comparison to major fluxes in the continental water
   balance. It also appears that the median result from the suite of
   models tends to do a better job of estimating climatological mean
   features than any individual model. Year-to-year variations in
   large-scale SWE are only weakly correlated to observed variations,
   indicating that sea surface temperatures ( specified from observations
   as boundary conditions) do not drive interannual variations of SWE in
   these models. These results have implications for simulations of the
   large-scale hydrologic cycle and for climate change impact assessments.}},

   shows that the retreat of the Northern Hemisphere's extent of spring
   snow cover over the past 20 years parallels a change in the influence
   of snow cover on the radiative balance and an observed increase of
   spring temperatures over the same area. These results help explain why
   the long-term (20th century) increase in surface air temperature over
   Northern Hemisphere land has been greater in spring than in any other
   season relative to the interannual variability.}},

	of snow to show the trends and developments. The observation of snow
	stratigraphy starts in the 18th and 19th century with a geologic
	focus, descriptions are superficial and only verbal. In the early
	20th century, the scientific interest in snow stratigraphy increases.
	Detailed descriptions and drawings become available. Slope scale
	geomorphologic features and surface processes were observed and documented.
	Starting from the 1940s, a shift of interest to the physical and
	mechanical properties in "homogeneous" layers takes place, from a
	slope-centred approach to a sample-centred approach. Stratigraphic
	description becomes one-dimensional, and the concept of well-defined
	layers gets accepted and still predominates today. However, all physical
	and mechanical processes are strongly related to the spatial variability
	of the snow mechanical properties. New instrumental developments
	show that the perceived strict layering may be a too simple model.
	The requirements for modern snow stratigraphy, integrating different

	abstract = {Snow stratigraphy and changes in snow hardness are amongst the most
	important parameters in the study of snow. In seven snow pits, three
	types of hardness tests were performed: these were hand, ram and
	micro penetrometer tests. The stratigraphy, in terms of layers and
	layer boundaries, was established from planar sections at a high
	spatial resolution, providing an objective reference for comparison
	with the analysed profiles. The snow layers and layer boundaries
	from the hardness profiles were compared with planar section stratigraphy.
	The hand test captured 80% of all layers and layer boundaries and
	the ram test 60%, and the micro penetrometer captured all the identified
	layers. Hand and ram profiles can only be used to determine an average
	hardness and stratigraphy. Important details are missed such as soft
	and thin hard layers, which are particularly significant for avalanche
	formation. Quantitative evaluation of mechanical and textural snowpack
	properties requires objective measurements with a spatial resolution
	of at least I mm. Since the predominant heat and mass fluxes are
	perpendicular to the snow surface, the more detailed stratification
	shown with the micro penetrometer has significant implications for
	mass and heat transfer within the snowpack. Numerical models not
	representing this small-scale layering will be misleading. Avalanche
	formation, snow hydrology and electromagnetic modelling (microwave
	emission and radar) are other examples of areas where a good resolution
	of the snowpack stratigraphy is important. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	today. a new high resolution snow penetrometer, the SnowMicroPen,
	has the potential to overcome several of the limitations of the classical
	tests. because the instrument samples with high spatial resolution,
	the interpretation of the recorded penetration force data has to
	be supported by signal processing and classification algorithms.
	Experiments during the winters 1996/97 and 1997/98 showed that the
	variation of the force signal is characteristic for different types
	of snow. Visualization of the signals spectrum can give qualitative
	information about the measurement. Weak layers thinner than 1mm can
	be detected in a snow profile in terms of their hardness. The penetration
	velocity is between 6-20 mm/s . a classification is developed to
	extract structural information of snow from the force signal. The
	classification is based on experiments with artificially metamorphosed
	snow and undisturbed snow from the Swiss Alps and Alaska. A structure
	index is defined and modeled to predict the structural stability
	via the coefficient of variation of the penetrometer force signal.
	Weak layers in natural profiles as thin as 4 mm can be classified
	in terms of their general strength and structural stability. the

	abstract = {{Thirty-three snowpack models of varying complexity and purpose were
   evaluated across a wide range of hydrometeorological and forest canopy
   conditions at five Northern Hemisphere locations, for up to two winter
   snow seasons. Modeled estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) or depth
   were compared to observations at forest and open sites at each
   location. Precipitation phase and duration of above-freezing air
   temperatures are shown to be major influences on divergence and
   convergence of modeled estimates of the subcanopy snowpack. When models
   are considered collectively at all locations, comparisons with
   observations show that it is harder to model SWE at forested sites than
   open sites. There is no universal ``best'' model for all sites or
   locations, but comparison of the consistency of individual model
   performances relative to one another at different sites shows that
   there is less consistency at forest sites than open sites, and even
   less consistency between forest and open sites in the same year. A good
   performance by a model at a forest site is therefore unlikely to mean a
   good model performance by the same model at an open site (and vice
   versa). Calibration of models at forest sites provides lower errors
   than uncalibrated models at three out of four locations. However,
   benefits of calibration do not translate to subsequent years, and
   benefits gained by models calibrated for forest snow processes are not

	penetration resistance and snow meso- and microstructure. The variation

	can be used in the field as well in the laboratory. The range of
	snow types which can be tested extends from light new snow (50 kg
	m(-3)) to very dense snow occurring on ski race tracks (500 kg m(-3)).
	The displacement resolution of the penetrometer is better than one
	mm to detect significant changes in resistance, the force signal
	is measured every 0.004 mm. The constant penetration velocity can
	be varied between 6 and 20 mm s(-1). A classification is developed
	to extract textural information of snow from the force signal. The
	classification is based on experiments with artificially metamorphosed
	snow and undisturbed snow from the Alps and Alaska. Two weak layers
	were identified and compared to surface sections, The new instrument
	makes the measurement of mechanical and stratigraphic features of
	a snowpack a more objective and easy task than with other methods.
	The high displacement resolution promises also a better identification
	of weak layers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   telemetry (SNOTEL) archives through the 1995/1996 season are used to
   examine the climatic characteristics of snow water equivalent (SWE) for
   the mountainous western United States and linkages with precipitation
   (PRE) and temperature. Quality control procedures were developed to
   screen outliers in each variable. SWE for April 1 at the SNOTEL sites
   compares favorably with colocated snow course values. Regional
   differences in the seasonal cycle of SWE are discussed in terms of
   winter-half precipitation, temperature, and the corresponding SWE/PRE
   ratio. The percentage of annual precipitation represented by snowfall
   is highest for the Sierra Nevada (67\%), northwestern Wyoming (64\%),
   Colorado (63\%), and Idaho/western Montana (62\%) sectors, manifesting
   high SWE/PRE ratios and winter-half precipitation maxima. Lower
   percentages for the Pacific Northwest (50\%) and Arizona/New Mexico
   (39\%) reflect lower ratios and, especially for the latter region, a
   larger fraction of PRE falling outside of the accumulation season.
   Interannual variability in SWE in the colder inland regions is
   primarily controlled by available precipitation. For the warmer Pacific
   coast regions and Arizona/New Mexico the more important factor is the
   SWE/PRE ratio, illustrating the sensitivity of these areas to climate
   change.}},

	abstract = {{Dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) theory is used to study the
   multiple-scattering effects in active microwave remote sensing.
   Simplified DMRT phase matrices are obtained in the 1-2 frame. The
   simplified expressions facilitate solutions of the DMRT equations and
   comparisons with other phase matrices. First-order, second-order, and
   full multiple-scattering solutions of the DMRT equations are obtained.
   To solve the DMRT equation, we decompose the diffuse intensities into
   Fourier series in the azimuthal direction. Each harmonic is solved by
   the eigen-quadrature approach. The model is applied to the active
   microwave remote sensing of terrestrial snow. Full multiple-scattering
   effects are important as the optical thickness for snow at frequencies
   above 10 GHz often exceed unity. The results are illustrated as a
   function of frequency, incidence angle, and snow depth. The results
   show that cross polarization for the case of densely packed spheres can
   be significant and can be merely 6 to 8 dB below copolarization. The
   magnitudes of the cross polarization are consistent with the
   experimental observations. The results show that the active 13.5-GHz
   backscattering coefficients still have significant sensitivity to snow
   thickness even for snow thickness exceeding 1 m.}},
