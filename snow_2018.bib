	Abstract = {There is increasing need to characterize the distribution of snow in complex terrain using remote sensing approaches, especially in isolated mountainous regions that are often water-limited, the principal source of terrestrial freshwater, and sensitive to climatic shifts and variations. We apply intensive topographic surveys, multi-temporal LiDAR, and Random Forest modeling to quantify snow volume and characterize associated errors across seven land cover types in a semi-arid mountainous catchment at a 1 and 4 m spatial resolution. The LiDAR-based estimates of both snow-off surface topology and snow depths were validated against ground-based measurements across the catchment. LiDAR-derived snow depths estimates were most accurate in areas of low lying vegetation such as meadow and shrub vegetation (RMSE = 0.14 m) as compared to areas consisting of tree cover (RMSE = 0.20-0.35 m). The highest errors were found along the edge of conifer forests (RMSE = 0.35 m), however a second conifer transect outside the catchment had much lower errors (RMSE = 0.21 m). This difference is attributed to the wind exposure of the first site that led to highly variable snow depths at short spatial distances. The Random Forest modeled errors deviated from the field measured errors with-a RMSE of 0.09-0.34 m across the different cover types. The modeling was used to calculate a theoretical lower and upper bound of catchment snow volume error of 21-30\%. Results show that snow drifts, which are important for maintaining spring and summer stream flows and establishing and sustaining water-limited plant species, contained 30 +/- 5-6\% of the snow volume while only occupying 10\% of the catchment area similar to findings by prior physically-based modeling approaches. This study demonstrates the potential utility of combining multi-temporal LiDAR with Random Forest modeling to quantify the distribution of snow depth with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

	Abstract = {{Snow provides essential resources/services in the form of water for
   human use, and climate regulation in the form of enhanced cooling of the
   Earth. In addition, it supports a thriving winter outdoor recreation
   industry. To date, the financial evaluation of the importance of snow is
   incomplete and hence the need for accelerated snow research is not as
   clear as it could be. With snow cover changing worldwide in several
   worrisome ways, there is pressing need to determine global, regional,
   and local rates of snow cover change, and to link these to financial
   analyses that allow for rational decision making, as risks related to
   those decisions involve trillions of dollars.
   Plain Language Summary Snow is critical in sustaining human life. It
   provides water and plays a key role in the climate through its unrivaled
   power to cool the Earth. It is also changing rapidly. To date, a full
   financial evaluation of the importance of snow in our lives has not been
   made, but computations here and elsewhere indicate it is on the order of
   trillions of dollars. Against this value, the current costs of
   scientific research are trivial. We provide a strong rationale and
   guidelines for accelerated snow research that will allow society to make
   major impending decisions related to snow resources on the soundest base

@article{Filhol:2015,
	Abstract = {{Snow bedforms, like sand bedforms, consist of various shapes that form
   under the action of wind on mobile particles. Throughout a year, they
   can cover up to 11\% of the Earth surface, concentrated toward the
   poles. These forms impact the local surface energy balance and the
   distribution of precipitation. Only a few studies have concentrated on
   their genesis. Their size ranges from 2cm (ripple marks) to 2.5m tall
   (whaleback dunes). We counted a total of seven forms that are widely
   recognized. Among them sastrugi, an erosional shape, is the most
   widespread. From laser scans, we compared scaling of snow versus sand
   barchan morphology. We found that both have proportionally the same
   footprint, but snow barchans are flatter. The key difference is that
   snow can sinter, immobilizing the bedform and creating an erodible
   material. Using a model, we investigated the effect of sintering on snow
   dune dynamics. We found that sintering limits their size because it
   progressively hardens the snow and requires an ever-increasing wind
   speed to maintain snow transport. From the literature and results from
   this model, we have reclassified snow bedforms based on two parameters:
   wind speed and snow surface conditions. The new data show that snow dune
   behavior mirrors that of sand dunes, with merging, calving, and
   collision. However, isolated snow barchans are rare, with most of the
   snow surfaces encountered in the field consisting of several
   superimposed bedforms formed sequentially during multiple weather
   events. Spatially variable snow properties and geometry can explain
   qualitatively these widespread compound snow surfaces.}},

	Abstract = {{Over the past 50 years, 239 papers related to snow have been published
   in Water Resources Research (WRR). Seminal papers on virtually every
   facet of snow physics and snow water resources have appeared in the
   journal. These include papers on drifting snow, the snow surface energy
   balance, the effect of grain size on albedo, chemical elution, water
   movement through snow, and canopy interception. In particular, papers in
   WRR have explored the distribution of snow across different landscapes,
   providing data, process knowledge, and the basis for virtually all of
   the distributed snow models in use today. In this paper, I review these
   key contributions and provide some personal thoughts on what is likely
   to be the focus and nature of papers published in the next few decades,
   a period that is likely to see an increasing ability to map snow cover
   in detail, which should serve as a basis for the further development and
   improvement of snow models. It will also be an uncertain future, with
   profound changes in snow climatology predicted. I expect WRR will
   continue to play a key role in documenting and understanding these
   important cryospheric changes.}},

	Abstract = {Large variations in both snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow slope stability are known to exist in the alpine snowpack, caused by wind, topographic and microclimatic effects. This variability makes extrapolation of point measurements of snowpack properties difficult and prone to error, but these types of measurements are used to estimate SWE and stability across entire mountain ranges. Radar technology provides a promising alternative to point measurements, because large areas can be covered quickly and non-intrusively. There is great potential for obtaining information on a large spatial scale from airborne applications. Frequency-modu fated continuous wave (FMCW) radar measurements were made from the ground in several different alpine snowpacks, along with manual and in situ electrical measurements. The surface and ground reflections from the radar data, combined with an average density estimate, can provide a useful estimate of SWE. In addition, the locations of internal reflections are highly correlated with both visually identified layers and measured changes in in situ dielectric properties.},

@article{King:2018,
	Abstract = {{Recent advancement in the understanding of snow-microwave interactions
   has helped to isolate the considerable potential for radar-based
   retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE). There are however, few
   datasets available to address spatial uncertainties, such as the
   influence of snow microstructure, at scales relevant to space-borne
   application. In this study we introduce measurements from SnowSAR, an
   airborne, dual-frequency (9.6 and 17.2 GHz) synthetic aperture radar
   (SAR), to evaluate high resolution (10 m) backscatter within a
   snow-covered tundra basin. Coincident in situ surveys at two sites
   characterize a generally thin snowpack (50 cm) interspersed with deeper
   drift features. Structure of the snowpack is found to be predominantly
   wind slab (65\%) with smaller proportions of depth hoar underlain
   (35\%). Objective estimates of snow microstructure (exponential
   correlation length; l(ex)), show the slab layers to be 2.8 times smaller
   than the basal depth hoar. In situ measurements are used to parametrize
   the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS3\&a) and
   compare against collocated SnowSAR backscatter. The evaluation shows a
   scaling factor (phi) between 1.37 and 1.08, when applied to input of
   l(ex), minimizes MEMLS root mean squared error to < 1.1 dB. Model
   sensitivity experiments demonstrate contrasting contributions from wind
   slab and depth hoar components, where wind rounded microstructures are
   identified as a strong control on observed backscatter. Weak sensitivity
   of SnowSAR to spatial variations in SWE is explained by the smaller
   contributing microstructures of the wind slab.}},

@article{Lin:2016,
	Abstract = {{European Space Agency's SnowScat instrument is a real aperture
   scatterometer which was developed by Gamma Remote Sensing AG. It
   operates in a continuous-wave mode, covers a frequency range of
   9.15-17.9 GHz in a user-defined frequency-step and has a full
   polarimetric capability. The measurement campaigns were started first in
   February 2009 at Weissfluhjoch, in Davos, Switzerland, as an initial
   test of the instrument over a deep alpine snowpack. Physical
   characterizations of the snowpack and meteorological measurements were
   carried out, which formed a detailed in situ dataset. SnowScat was then
   moved to Sodankyla in Finland in early November 2009, a site of the
   Finnish Meteorological Institute in Lapland. In addition to the in situ
   snowpack characterizations and meteorological observations, continuous
   passive microwave observations were also performed. During the 2012-2013
   winter period, a vertical time-domain snow profiling experiment was
   carried out in addition for resolving the scattering contributions
   fromthe snow layers of different physical properties. This paper
   summarizes the results of the SnowScat observations and initial
   comparisons against the in situ meteorological and snowpack data. The
   Sodankyla campaign data evidenced the high variability of the radar
   backscatter behavior of snowpack from year to year, which indicates its
   strong dependency on changing snow microstructure. Indeed, the snow
   microstructure is continuously driven by snow metamorphism, which are
   further affected by meteorological conditions and their interannual
   variability. The backscattering property of snowpack in the range X-to
   Ku-band for all polarizations appeared to be dominated by its
   microstructural morphology and underlying ground conditions, and to a
   lesser extent by the snow depth, or its snow-water-equivalent.}},

	Abstract = {{During the 2010/11 boreal winter, a distributed set of backscatter
   measurements was collected using a ground-based Ku-band (17.2 GHz)
   scatterometer system at 26 open tundra sites. A standard snow-sampling
   procedure was completed after each scan to evaluate local variability in
   snow layering, depth, density and water equivalent (SWE) within the
   scatterometer field of view. The shallow depths and large basal depth
   hoar encountered presented an opportunity to evaluate backscatter under
   a set of previously untested conditions. Strong Ku-band response was
   found with increasing snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE). In
   particular, co-polarized vertical backscatter increased by 0.82 dB for
   every 1 cm increase in SWE (R-2 = 0.62). While the result indicated
   strong potential for Ku-band retrieval of shallow snow properties, it
   did not characterize the influence of sub-scan variability. An enhanced

   characterizations of stratigraphy within the scatterometer field of view
   using near-infrared photography along the length of a 5 m trench.
   Changes in snow properties along the trench were used to discuss

   response related to short length scale spatial variability in the

   2006-2008 for the second Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX-II) in
   Colorado are described in this paper. The data showed the response of
   the Ku-band radar echoes to snowpack changes for various types of
   background vegetation in the study site in north central Colorado. We
   observed about 0.15-0.5-dB increases in backscatter for every 1 cm of
   snow-water-equivalent (SWE) accumulation for areas with short vegetation
   (sagebrush and pasture). The region with the smaller amount of biomass,
   signified by the backscatter in November, seemed to have the stronger
   backscatter response to SWE in decibels. The data also showed the impact
   of surface hoar growth and freeze/thaw cycles, which created large
   snow-grain sizes, ice crust layers, and ice lenses and consequently
   increased the radar signals by a few decibels. The copolarized HH/VV
   backscatter ratio seems to indicate double-bounce scattering between the
   ground surface and snow or vegetation. The cross-polarized backscatter
   {[}vertical-horizontal (VH)] showed not only the influence of vegetation
   but also the strong response to snow accumulation. The observed HV/VV
   ratio suggests the importance of multiple scattering or nonspherical

   snow cover as it rapidly retreats during the melting season, and is of
   high value to hydro power companies.
   Snow water equivalent is the key parameter for hydrological
   applications. Norut IT has developed a technique using repeat pass
   interferometry to measure SWE, based on the linear relationship between
   the change in SWE and the change in interferometric phase. The technique
   has been demonstrated, but scarceness of usable interferometric baseline
   pairs have so far not allowed wide spread applicability of the
   technique.
   A future SAR using Ku-band frequency as carrier will maybe solve the
   problem of retrieving SWE. Since backscatter at Ku-band frequency is
   more sensitive to SWE, it is good hope that robust SAR methods can be
   invented for this purpose. It will, however, be extremely important for
   the scientific community to validate the retrieval algorithms against
   in-situ data. The authors have developed an innovative validation
   concept using ground-penetrating radars at the same carrier frequencies
   as the space borne SARs to validate EO data in an efficient manner. The
   concept has been studied at C-band frequencies on glaciers at Svalbard,
   and we hope to build a similar platform for Ku-band frequencies, which
   will be used to validate model based retrieval algorithms.}},

	Abstract = {{A three-dimensional snowpack scattering and emission model is developed
   by numerically solving Maxwell's equations (NMM3D) over the entire
   snowpack on an underlying half-space. The solutions are crucial to
   microwave remote sensing that requires the preservation of coherent
   phase information. The heterogeneous snowpack is represented as a
   bicontinuous medium. Effects of the underlying half-space are included
   through a half-space Green's function in a volume integral equation
   formulation. The volume integral equation is then solved using the
   discrete dipole approximation. The fast Fourier transform is effectuated
   for all three dimensions with half-space Green's function rather than
   the conventional free space Green's function. To overcome the snow
   volume truncation in the finite numerical calculations, periodic
   boundary conditions are applied in the lateral extent. Thus, in NMM3D,
   the physical microwave scattering and emission problem is solved without
   using any radiative transfer equations. In this formulation, the
   scattering matrix of the snowpack accounts for both the magnitude and
   phase. The NMM3D simulations are demonstrated at Ku-band frequency for a
   snow cover up to 25-cm thick. The results are applicable to remote
   sensing of snow over sea ice, and thin layers of terrestrial snow.
   Quantitative values of backscattering and bistatic scattering
   coefficients are derived for active microwave remote sensing, and
   brightness temperatures for passive microwave remote sensing. The full
   wave simulation results are compared with those of the partially
   coherent approach of the dense media radiative transfer (DMRT). The
   NMM3D results capture effects of backscattering enhancement and coherent
   layering that are missed in DMRT. The full wave solution to Maxwell
   equations is important to advance radar polarimetry, interferometry, and
   tomography that require the preservation of the full phase information
   and all interface interactions for applications to radar remote sensing
   of snow cover on land and on sea ice.}},

   scattering effects through the Quasi-Crystalline Approximation. The
   result of this derivation is a simplified version of the InSAR
   correlation model derived for relating the InSAR correlation
   measurements to the snowpack characteristics of grain size, volume
   fraction, and layer depth as well as those aspects of the volume-ground
   interaction that affects the interferometric observation (i.e., the
   surface topography and the ratio of ground-to-volume scattering). Based
   on the model, the sensitivity of the InSAR correlation measurements to
   the snow characteristics is explored by simulation. Through this
   process, it is shown that Ka-band InSAR phase has a good sensitivity to
   snow grain size and volume fraction, while for lower frequency signals
   (Ku-band to L-band), the InSAR correlation magnitude and phase have a
   sensitivity to snow depth. Since the formulation depends, in part, on

   Microwaves interact with snow by absorption, scattering, and refraction.
   For dry snow of a few meters depth and frequencies below 20 GHz,

   with the backscattered energy from the underlying ground. The signal

   cycles are reconstructed with a two-frequency approach. Temporal
   decorrelation is minimized by a temporal resolution of 4 h. A linear

   Radar (InSAR) to generate a time-series of snow water equivalent (SWE)

   the winter of 1993/1994. Maps depicting relative change in phase and the
   theoretical relative change in SWE between satellite acquisitions are
   created for 3-day periods at the end of March 1994 using both ascending
   and descending ERS-1 overpasses. The theoretical coefficient relating
   relative change in phase and relative change in SWE for C-band is found
   to be at least twice as large as what is expected when using a simple
   single-layer snow model for this study area and time period. Without any
   direct measurements of SWE on the ground, station measurements of snow
   depth and hourly wind are linked to each 3-day relative change in phase
   map. Along with a qualitative assessment, quantitative measures of the
   rate and magnitude of phase change around these stations are directly
   compared to the hourly wind data for a given 3-day period. InSAR-derived
   maps acquired around a measured precipitation event show a considerable
   relationship to the predominant direction of strong winds over each
   3-day period while maps acquired around no measureable precipitation
   depict much less correlation between phase change and predominant
   direction of strong winds. Despite limited ground measurements to infer

   contribution from a dry snow cover is from the snow-ground interface.
   Thus, the interferometric phase of two SAR images, one with no snow and

   a delta-K processing of the two SAR scenes followed by averaging, an
   estimation of the SWE can be achieved. The first step in the delta-K

   two new carrier frequencies with a small delta frequency or delta-K
   separation. The next step is to multiply the two subband images together
   to obtain the delta-K image, one for summer and one for winter. Finally,
   the delta-K interferometric SAR image is generated by multiplying the
   two delta-K images from summer and winter together. In this letter,

   Interferometric SAR (InSAR) exploits the phase differences of at least
   two complex-valued SAR images acquired from different orbit positions

   statistical properties of the involved quantities. Coherence is shown to
   be a useful concept for system description and for interferogram quality
   assessment. As a key step in InSAR signal processing two-dimensional
   phase unwrapping is discussed in detail. Several interferometric
   configurations are described and illustrated by real-world examples. A
   compilation of past, current and future InSAR systems concludes the
   paper.}},

   backscattering coefficients at C- and X-band (5.5 and 9.6 GHz) can be
   either positive or negative. Therefore, discovery of the relationship
   with an empirical approach is unrealistic. Instead, we estimate snow
   depth and particle size using SIR-C/X-SAR imagery from a
   physically-based first order backscattering model through analyses of
   the importance of each scattering term and its sensitivity to snow
   properties. Using numerically simulated backscattering values, we

   backscattering components, and the snowpack extinction properties at
   C-band and X-band. With these relationships, snow depth and optical
   equivalent grain size can be estimated from SIR-C/X-SAR measurements.
   Validation using three SIR-C/X-SAR images shows that the algorithm

	Abstract = {Accurate characterization of snow-covered area (SCA) and snow water equivalent (SWE) in complex terrain is needed to improve estimation of streamflow timing and volume, and is important for land surface modeling. Direct field observations of SWE, SCA and atmospheric forcing inputs for models of snow accumulation and ablation are typically sparsely sampled in space. Satellite imagery is, therefore, a critical tool for verification and confirmation of snow model estimates of SCA. The Landsat system provides snow-covered area estimates at a spatial resolution of 30 m with a 16-day return interval, while daily estimates of SCA and fractional SCA (f(SCA)) are available at 500 m from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This study describes and tests a linear model to downscale MODIS MOD10A1 f(SCA) (500 m) data to higher-resolution (30 m) spatially explicit binary SCA estimates. The algorithm operates on the assumption that two variables, potential insolation and elevation, control differential ablation of snow cover throughout spring melt at 30 m to 500 m scales. The model downscales daily 500 f(SCA) estimates from MODIS to provide daily SCA estimates at a spatial resolution of 30 m, using limited Landsat SCA for calibration and independent Landsat SCA estimates for validation. Downscaled SCA estimates demonstrate statistically significant improvement from randomly generated model ensembles, indicating that insolation and elevation are dominant factors controlling the snow cover distribution in the semi-arid, mountainous region in southwestern Idaho, USA where this study is performed. Validation is performed with Landsat data not used for calibration, and is also performed using Landsat 500 m aggregate f(SCA) instead of MODIS f(SCA) as an ideal case. Downscaled estimates show reasonable accuracy (test metric outperforms random ensembles at p = 0.01 significance level for multiple ranges of snow cover) with only one calibrated parameter.

	Abstract = {This study investigates causes behind correlations between snow and terrain properties in a 27 km(2) mountain watershed. Whereas terrain correlations reveal where snow resides, the physical processes responsible for correlations can be ambiguous. We conducted biweekly snow surveys at small transect scales to provide insight into late-season correlations at the basin scale. The evolving parameters of transect variograms reveal the interplay between differential accumulation and differential ablation that is responsible for correlations between snow and terrain properties including elevation, aspect, and canopy density. Elevation-induced differential accumulation imposes a persistent source of varariabity at the basin scale, but is not sufficient to explain the elevational distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) on the ground. Differential ablation, with earlier and more frequent ablation at lower elevations, steepens the SWE-elevation gradient through the season. Correlations with aspect are primarily controlled by differences in solar loading. Aspect related redistribution of precipitation by wind, however, is important early in the season. Forested sites hold more snow than nonforested sites at the basin scale due to differences in ablation processes, while open areas within forested sites hold more snow than covered areas due to interception. However, as the season progresses energetic differences between open and covered areas within forested sites cause differences induced by interception to diminish. Results of this study can help determine which accumulation and ablation processes must be represented explicitly and which can be parameterized in models of snow dynamics.},

@article{Bloschl:1999,
	Abstract = {The concept of scale can be used to quantify characteristic lengths of (a) a natural process (such as the correlation length of the spatial snow water equivalent (SWE) variability); (b) a measurement (such as the size of a snow density sample or the footprint of a satellite sensor), and (c) a model (such as the grid size of a distributed snow model). The different types of scales are denoted as process scale, measurement scale and model scale, respectively. Interpolations, extrapolations, aggregations, and disaggregations are viewed as a change in model scale and/or measurement scale.

In a first step we examine, in a linear stochastic analysis, the effect of measurement scale and model scale on the data and the model predictions. It is shown that the ratio of the measurement scale and the process scale, and the ratio of the model scale and the process scale are the driving parameters for the scale effects. These scale effects generally cause biases in the variances and spatial correlation lengths of satellite images, field measurements, and simulation results of snow models. It is shown, by example, how these biases can be identified and corrected by regularization methods. At the core of these analyses is the variogram. For the case of snow cover patterns, it is shown that it may be difficult to infer the true snow cover variability from the variograms, particularly when they span many orders of magnitude.

In a second step we examine distributed snow models which are a non-linear deterministic approach to changing the scale. Unlike in the linear case, in these models a change of scale may also bias the mean over a catchment of snow-related variables such as SWE. There are a number of fundamental scaling issues with distributed models which include subgrid variability, the question of an optimum element size, and parameter identifiability. We give methods for estimating subgrid variability. We suggest that, in general, an optimum element size may not exist and that the model element scale may in practice be dictated by data availability and the required resolution of the predictions. The scale effects in distributed non-linear models can be related to the linear stochastic case which allows us to generalize the applicability of regularization methods. While most of the paper focuses on physical snow processes, similar conclusions apply and similar methods are applicable to chemical and biological processes.

	Abstract = {Fractal dimensions derived from log-log variograms are useful for characterizing spatial structure and scaling behavior in snow depth distributions. This study examines the temporal consistency of snow depth scaling features at two sites using snow depth distributions derived from lidar datasets collected in 2003 and 2005. The temporal snow accumulation patterns in these two years were substantially different, but both years represent nearly average 1 April accumulation depths for these sites, with consistent statistical distributions. Two distinct fractal regions are observed in each log-log variogram, separated by a scale break, which indicates a length scale at which a substantial change in the driving processes exists. The lag distance of the scale break is 15 m at the Walton Creek site and 40 m at the Alpine site. The datasets show consistent fractal dimensions and scale break distances between the two years, suggesting that the scaling features observed in spatial snow depth distributions are largely determined by physiography and vegetation characteristics and are relatively insensitive to annual variations in snowfall. Directional variograms also show consistent patterns between years, with smaller fractal dimensions aligned with the dominant wind direction at each site.},

	Abstract = {Snowpack properties vary dramatically over a wide range of spatial scales, from crystal microstructure to regional snow climates. The driving forces of wind, energy balance, and precipitation interact with topography and vegetation to dominate snow depth variability at horizontal scales from 1 to 1000 m. This study uses land surface elevation, vegetation surface elevation, and snow depth data measured using airborne lidar at three sites in north-central Colorado. Fractal dimensions are estimated from the slope of a log-transformed variogram and demonstrate scale-invariant, fractal behavior in the elevation, vegetation, and snow depth datasets. Snow depth and vegetation topography each show two distinct fractal distributions over different scale ranges (multifractal behavior), with short-range fractal dimensions near 2.5 and long-range fractal dimensions around 2.9 at all locations. These fractal ranges are separated by a scale break at 15-40 m, depending on the site, which indicates a process change at that scale. Terrain has a fractal distribution over nearly the entire range of scales available in the data. Directional differences in the fractal dimensions for each parameter are also present at multiple scales, and are related to the wind direction frequency distributions at each site. The results indicate that different sampling resolutions may yield different results and allow rescaling in specific scale ranges. Resolutions of 10 m and finer are consistently self-similar, as are resolutions greater than 30 m, though the coarser resolutions show nearly random distributions.},

	Abstract = {Runoff from snowmelt is regarded as a vital water source for people and ecosystems throughout the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Numerous studies point to the threat global warming poses to the timing and magnitude of snow accumulation and melt. But analyses focused on snow supply do not show where changes to snowmelt runoff are likely to present the most pressing adaptation challenges, given sub-annual patterns of human water consumption and water availability from rainfall. We identify the NH basins where present spring and summer snowmelt has the greatest potential to supply the human water demand that would otherwise be unmet by instantaneous rainfall runoff. Using a multi-model ensemble of climate change projections, we find that these basins---which together have a present population of ∼2 billion people---are exposed to a 67% risk of decreased snow supply this coming century. Further, in the multi-model mean, 68 basins (with a present population of >300 million people) transition from having sufficient rainfall runoff to meet all present human water demand to having insufficient rainfall runoff. However, internal climate variability creates irreducible uncertainty in the projected future trends in snow resource potential, with about 90% of snow-sensitive basins showing potential for either increases or decreases over the near-term decades. Our results emphasize the importance of snow for fulfilling human water demand in many NH basins, and highlight the need to account for the full range of internal climate variability in developing robust climate risk management decisions.},
