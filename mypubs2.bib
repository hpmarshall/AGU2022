	abstract = {[1] Contributions to sea level rise from rapidly retreating marine-terminating glaciers are large and increasing. Strong increases in iceberg calving occur during retreat, which allows mass transfer to the ocean at a much higher rate than possible through surface melt alone. To study this process, we deployed an 11-sensor passive seismic network at Columbia Glacier, Alaska, during 2004 - 2005. We show that calving events generate narrow-band seismic signals, allowing frequency domain detections. Detection parameters were determined using direct observations of calving and validated using three statistical methods and hypocenter locations. The 1 - 3 Hz detections provide a good measure of the temporal distribution and size of calving events. Possible source mechanisms for the unique waveforms are discussed, and we analyze potential forcings for the observed seismicity.},

	abstract = {[1] Detailed three-dimensional in-situ measurements of deformation at depth are used to examine the rheology of a 6 x 10(6) m(3) block of temperate glacier ice. Assuming that the viscosity of this ice is primarily dependent on stress, the relationship between inferred stress and measurements of strain-rate above similar to 115 m depth suggest a constitutive relationship with a stress exponent n similar to 1. Deformation below 115 m is described by a non-linear flow law with a power exponent of approximately 3-4. A sharp transition between the two flow regimes is likely caused by a change in the dominant mechanism from superplastic flow, basal slip, and/or diffusional flow near the surface to dislocation and intragranular deformation at depth.},

	abstract = {Sliding glaciers and brittle ice failure generate seismic body and surface wave energy characteristic to the source mechanism. Here we analyze continuous seismic recordings from an array of nine short-period passive seismometers located on Bench Glacier, Alaska (USA) (61.033 degrees N, 145.687 degrees W). We focus on the arrival-time and amplitude information of the dominant Rayleigh wave phase. Over a 46-hour period we detect thousands of events using a cross-correlation based event identification method. Travel-time inversion of a subset of events (7\% of the total) defines an active crevasse, propagating more than 200 meters in three hours. From the Rayleigh wave amplitudes, we estimate the amount of volumetric opening along the crevasse as well as an average bulk attenuation ((Q) over bar = 42) for the ice in this part of the glacier. With the remaining icequake signals we establish a diurnal periodicity in seismicity, indicating that surface run-off and subglacial water pressure changes likely control the triggering of these surface events. Furthermore, we find that these events are too weak (i.e., too noisy) to locate individually. However, stacking individual events increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the waveforms, implying that these periodic sources are effectively stationary during the recording period.},

	abstract = {Large variations in both snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow slope stability are known to exist in the alpine snowpack, caused by wind, topographic and microclimatic effects. This variability makes extrapolation of point measurements of snowpack properties difficult and prone to error, but these types of measurements are used to estimate SWE and stability across entire mountain ranges. Radar technology provides a promising alternative to point measurements, because large areas can be covered quickly and non-intrusively. There is great potential for obtaining information on a large spatial scale from airborne applications. Frequency-modu fated continuous wave (FMCW) radar measurements were made from the ground in several different alpine snowpacks, along with manual and in situ electrical measurements. The surface and ground reflections from the radar data, combined with an average density estimate, can provide a useful estimate of SWE. In addition, the locations of internal reflections are highly correlated with both visually identified layers and measured changes in in situ dielectric properties.},

	abstract = {Mass changes of Blue Glacier, USA are calculated from topographic maps made from vertical aerial photography in late summer of 1939, 1952, 1957, and 1987. along with laser altimetry flown in June 1996. Changes in elevation between maps were adjusted for seasonal variations in the snow cover, and to account for the ablation between the date of photography and 1 October. Topography obtained from the laser altimetry was adjusted for snow thickness and glacier motion to estimate topography of 1 October 1995. The mass of Blue Glacier has changed less than 7 m (water equivalent) during this 56 year period which is minor compared with other glaciers in the region and elsewhere in the world. Glacier-average annual mass balances, beginning in 1956, have been calculated either from stake measurements and probing of late-season snow, or from a regression analysis using late-season measurements of the equilibrium line altitude. A comparison with the changes derived from surface maps shows values obtained from field measurements are too positive by about 0.5 m a(-1). indicating that considerable caution is needed when interpreting time series of mass balance. Two alternative time series of mess balance consistent with the long-term mass changes are created by making simple adjustments: (i) a single constant is subtracted from each value so that the series is consistent with the 1957-95 mass change; (2) one constant is subtracted from each value over 1957-87 and another is subtracted from each value over 1987-95 so that the series is consistent with both the 1957-87 and 1987-95 mass changes.

The mass balance of Blue Glacier was generally positive until the mid-1970s and negative since. The fluctuations of mass balance closely resemble those of snowfall on the glacier as estimated from the joins distribution of temperature and precipitation. The climate in western Washington was cooler and wetter during the decade before the mid-1970s, but the trend since has been towards warmer and drier conditions.},

@article{Lutz:2009,
	abstract = {Researchers and practitioners have long utilized a variety of penetrometers to investigate the snowpack. Identifying definitive relationships between penetrometer-derived microstructural information and stability has been challenging. The purpose of this study is two-fold: 1. We propose a simple field test to establish relationships between load and penetrometer-derived microstructural estimates. 2. We utilize the SnowMicroPen (SMP) to quantify changes in weak layer residual strength and microstructural dimension associated with an artificial loading event Our dataset is from Moonlight Basin, Montana and includes three modified loaded-column tests, each paired with 5 SMP profiles. Depth hoar comprised the targeted weak layer. Results indicate that loading caused the residual strength and rupture frequency to decrease significantly. Much like a compression test at a micro-scale, the force required for the SMP to rupture individual structures as well as the micro-scale strength decreased significantly when the slab stress was increased by artificially adding blocks of snow. A decrease in observed rupture frequency within the weak layer (or an increase in the distance between ruptured structures) also occurred after the loading event. probably because some structures within the weak layer had already failed or were so close to failing that the penetrometer could not detect their rupture. Due in part to the large difference in loads, microstructural differences between the natural and loaded columns were significant enough that only one profile would have been necessary to determine a significant difference in residual strength. Artificial removal of slab stress resulted in greater rupture forces and larger microstructures, likely due to elastic rebound. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ground-based frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar measurements made throughout the 2002-03 NASA Cold Lands Processes (CLPX) mission in Colorado, USA, were designed to study the major electromagnetic transitions within the alpine snowpack over a wide range of conditions, and their effect on measurements made with different active radar measurement parameters. Measurements during 2002 determined that measurements at C-, X-, and Ku-band frequencies were necessary to retrieve the most snowpack information in a wide range of conditions. Measurements at four different incidence angles indicated that the snowpack layering was still visible at 15degrees but that the rough surface scattering of the snow-ground interface dominated the signal above 30degrees incidence. Measurements during 2003 were focused on characterizing the microwave response at C-, X-, and Ku-band frequencies at four different sites with different snowpack conditions, indicating that the optimal measurement parameters vary with snowpack conditions. Measurements at different bandwidths illustrate the effect of bandwidth on vertical resolution. This ground-truth data will help interpretation of air- and space-borne active and passive microwave radar measurements that were made coincident with this study. In addition, this work may help guide future researchers when choosing FMCW radar measurement parameters, depending on the type of snowpack information their study requires.

	abstract = {Stability prediction from SnowMicroPen (SMP) profiles would support avalanche forecasting operations, since objective stability information could be gathered more quickly than with standard tests, thereby allowing sampling at higher resolution and over larger spatial scales. Previous studies have related the snow properties derived from the SMP to observed snow properties at Rutschblock (RB) and compression test failure planes. The goals of this study are to show to what extent snowpack stability for artificial triggering, based on RB. can be derived from SMP measurements and how multiple measurements at the RB scale improve the results. Measurements at 36 different sites were used for the development of a classification scheme. Each site included a RB test, a manual profile, and 6 to 10 adjacent SMP measurements, for a total of 262 SMP profiles. A recently improved SMP theory was applied to estimate the micro-structural and mechanical properties of manually defined weak layers and slab layers. SMP signal quality control and different noise treatment methods were taken into consideration in the analysis. The best and most robust predictor of RB stability was the weak layer micro-scale strength. In combination with the SMP-estimated mean density of the slab layer, the total accuracy of predicting RB stability classes was 85\% over the entire dataset, and 88\% when signals with obvious signal dampening (11\% of the dataset) were removed. The total accuracy increased when multiple SMP measurements at the RB scale were used to calculate the mean weak layer strength, when compared to using just one SMP measurement at a site. The analysis was robust to trends and offsets in the absolute SMP force, which was a frequent signal error. However, it was sensitive to dampened or disturbed SMP force micro variance. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the best predictor of instability. the weak layer micro-scale strength, was robust to the choice of SMP signal noise removal method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The stratigraphy of an alpine snowpack is very important for avalanche danger assessment, as well as interpretation of remote sensing measurements for hydrological purposes. Since spatial variability is often widespread, due mainly to wind, micro-climatic and topographic effects, extrapolating point measurements can be difficult. Tools which can quickly characterize snowpack stratigraphy, such as high frequency radar and mechanical probes, will be required for a complete understanding of the effects of spatial variability, however interpretation of these kinds of measurements still remains challenging. We compare measurements from a portable 8-18 GHz Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with SnowMicroPenetrometer (SMP) and standard snowpit measurements. Although significant variability existed at the sub-meter scale, major stratigraphic horizons could be followed along radar profiles and identified in SMP measurements. A very thin hard crust (0.2-0.4 mm) that was continuous caused strong signals that were identifiable in both the SMP and the radar measurements at five different sites along a 10 m traverse. Two other more subtle transitions in the SMP signal were highly correlated with the locations of radar reflections. This work suggests that combining FMCW radar measurements, to characterize snowpack geometry, with SMP measurements, to characterize mechanical properties of layers, may be a useful technique for quantifying the spatial variability of the snowpack.

On smaller scales, bedrock infiltration is an important term in water mass balance studies, which attempt to estimate hydrologic states and fluxes in watersheds with fractured or transmissive bedrock. We estimate the a daily time series of bedrock infiltration in a small catchment in the rain snow transition zone in southwest Idaho, using the difference between measured stream discharge and modeled soil drainage. The accuracy of spatial patterns in soil water storage are optimized, rather than the more common approach of minimizing error in integrated quantities such as streamflow. Bedrock infiltration is estimated to be 289 mm 50 mm for the 2011 water year, which is 34\% +/- 12\% of the precipitation (95\% confidence). Soils on the southwest facing slope drain more often throughout the snow season, but the northeast facing slope contributes more total soil drainage for the water year. Peaks in catchment soil drainage and bedrock infiltration coincide with rain on snow events. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {On 19 January 2012, a large D3 avalanche (approximately 10(3) t) was recorded with an infrasound array ideally situated for observing the avalanche velocity. The avalanche crossed Highway 21 in Central Idaho during the largest avalanche cycle in the 15 years of recorded history and deposited approximately 8 m of snow on the roadway. Possible source locations along the avalanche path were estimated at 0.5 s intervals and were used to calculate the avalanche velocity during the 64 s event. Approximately 10 s prior to the main avalanche signal, a small infrasound signal originated from the direction of the start zone. We infer this to be the initial snow pack failure, a precursory signal to the impending avalanche. The avalanche accelerated to a maximum velocity of 35.9 7.6m s(-1) within 30 s before impacting the highway. We present a new technique to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution velocity estimates not previously demonstrated with infrasound for avalanches and other mass wasting events.},

	abstract = {Deposition of snow from precipitation and wind events creates layering within seasonal snowpacks. The thickness and horizontal continuity of layers within seasonal snowpacks can be highly variable, due to snow blowing around topography and vegetation, and this has important implications for hydrology, remote sensing and avalanche forecasting. In this paper, we present practical field and post-processing protocols for recording lateral variations in snow stratigraphy using near-infrared (NIR) photography. A Fuji S9100 digital camera, modified lobe sensitive to NIR wavelengths, was mounted on a rail system that allowed for rapid imaging of a 10 m long snow trench excavated on the north side of Toolik Lake, Alaska (68 degrees 38'N, 149 degrees 36'W). Post-processing of the images included removal of lens distortion and vignetting. A tape measure running along the base of the trench provided known locations (control points) that permitted scaling and georeferencing. Snow layer heights estimated from the NIR images compared well with manual stratigraphic measurements made at 0.2 m intervals along the trench (n = 357, R(2) = 0.97). Considerably greater stratigraphic detail was captured by the NIR images than in the manually recorded profiles. NIR imaging of snow trenches using the described protocols is an efficient tool for quantifying continuous microscale variations in snow layers and associated properties.},

@article{Hedrick:2015,
	abstract = {Repeated light detection and ranging (lidar) surveys are quickly becoming the de facto method for measuring spatial variability of montane snowpacks at high resolution. This study examines the potential of a 750 km(2) lidar-derived data set of snow depths, collected during the 2007 northern Colorado Cold Lands Processes Experiment (CLPX-2), as a validation source for an operational hydrologic snow model. The SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) model framework, operated by the US National Weather Service, combines a physically based energy-and-mass-balance snow model with satellite, airborne and automated ground-based observations to provide daily estimates of snowpack properties at nominally 1 km resolution over the conterminous United States. Independent validation data are scarce due to the assimilating nature of SNODAS, compelling the need for an independent validation data set with substantial geographic coverage.

Within 12 distinctive 500 x 500m study areas located throughout the survey swath, ground crews performed approximately 600 manual snow depth measurements during each of the CLPX-2 lidar acquisitions. This supplied a data set for constraining the uncertainty of upscaled lidar estimates of snow depth at the 1 km SNODAS resolution, resulting in a root-mean-square difference of 13 cm. Upscaled lidar snow depths were then compared to the SNODAS estimates over the entire study area for the dates of the lidar flights. The remotely sensed snow depths provided a more spatially continuous comparison data set and agreed more closely to the model estimates than that of the in situ measurements alone. Finally, the results revealed three distinct areas where the differences between lidar observations and SNODAS estimates were most drastic, providing insight into the causal influences of natural processes on model uncertainty.},

@article{Anderson:2014,
	abstract = {This study investigates causes behind correlations between snow and terrain properties in a 27 km(2) mountain watershed. Whereas terrain correlations reveal where snow resides, the physical processes responsible for correlations can be ambiguous. We conducted biweekly snow surveys at small transect scales to provide insight into late-season correlations at the basin scale. The evolving parameters of transect variograms reveal the interplay between differential accumulation and differential ablation that is responsible for correlations between snow and terrain properties including elevation, aspect, and canopy density. Elevation-induced differential accumulation imposes a persistent source of varariabity at the basin scale, but is not sufficient to explain the elevational distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) on the ground. Differential ablation, with earlier and more frequent ablation at lower elevations, steepens the SWE-elevation gradient through the season. Correlations with aspect are primarily controlled by differences in solar loading. Aspect related redistribution of precipitation by wind, however, is important early in the season. Forested sites hold more snow than nonforested sites at the basin scale due to differences in ablation processes, while open areas within forested sites hold more snow than covered areas due to interception. However, as the season progresses energetic differences between open and covered areas within forested sites cause differences induced by interception to diminish. Results of this study can help determine which accumulation and ablation processes must be represented explicitly and which can be parameterized in models of snow dynamics.},

	abstract = {Observations and measurements indicate rain often has a major impact on snow slope stability. Measurements to investigate the effects of wetting of low density, alpine snow were made at Snoqualmie Pass, WA, USA. Results indicate that on first wetting, the densification rate can increase by three orders of magnitude. This initial burst of densification occurs independently of the gravitational load and is probably a result of rapid structural changes and grain rearrangement that occurs when liquid water is first introduced. The rate decreases rapidly with time, although it remains about two orders of magnitude higher than that for dry snow of the same density. The rate of densification decreases as density increases. We assume snow behaves as a linear viscous fluid and that the metamorphic and gravitational components of compaction are additive. A simple model of compaction is derived empirically using the measurements. The model fits the measurements very well, although more experiments are needed to determine the dependence of the model parameters on liquid water content. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Snow microstructure plays an important role in the remote sensing of snow water equivalent (SWE) for both passive and active microwave radars. The accuracy of microwave SWE retrieval algorithms is sensitive to (usually unknown) changes in microstructure. These algorithms could be improved with high-resolution estimates of microstructural properties by using an advanced instrument such as the Snow Micro Penetrometer (SMP), which measures penetration force at the millimeter scale and is sensitive to microstructure. The SMP can also take full micromechanical measurements at much greater speed and resolution and without observer bias than a traditional snow pit. Previous studies have shown that the snowpack stratigraphy and grain type can be accurately classified with one SMP measurement using basic statistics and classification trees (CTs). For this study, we used basic statistical measures of the penetration force and micromechanical estimates from an SMP inversion algorithm to significantly improve the classification accuracy of grain type and layer discrimination. We applied random forest (RF) techniques to classify three snow grain types (new snow, rounds, and facets) from SMP measurements collected in Switzerland and Grand Mesa, Colorado. RFs performed up to 8\% better than single CTs, with overall misclassification errors between 17\% and 40\%. The coefficient of variation of the penetration force proved to be the most important variable, followed by variables that contain information about grain size like microscale strength and the number of ruptures.},

	abstract = {Large, late-winter ptarmigan migrations heavily impact the shoot, plant, and patch architecture of shrubs that remain above the snow surface. Ptarmigan browsing on arctic shrubs was assessed in the vicinity of Toolik Lake, on the north side of the Brooks Range in Alaska. Data were collected in early May 2007, at maximum snow depth, after the bulk of the ptarmigan migration had passed through the area. In an area of tall shrubs, half of the buds on Salix alaxensis were browsed by ptarmigan. Three percent of the buds that were buried beneath the snow were browsed, 90\% of the buds that were less than 30 cm above the maximum snow level were browsed, and 45\% of the buds above that height were browsed. Ptarmigan browsing was found to be a major height limiter for tall shrubs, thereby controlling shrub architecture by brooming stems at the snow surface and inducing stump shoots. These results were qualitatively extrapolated by photographing shrub morphology over a region approximately 300 km wide across a series of north-flowing arctic rivers with headwaters in the Brooks Range. Ptarmigan "hedging" of shrub patches, and shrub growth under a warmer climate, are opposing forces mediated by snow distribution.},

	abstract = {Accurate characterization of snow-covered area (SCA) and snow water equivalent (SWE) in complex terrain is needed to improve estimation of streamflow timing and volume, and is important for land surface modeling. Direct field observations of SWE, SCA and atmospheric forcing inputs for models of snow accumulation and ablation are typically sparsely sampled in space. Satellite imagery is, therefore, a critical tool for verification and confirmation of snow model estimates of SCA. The Landsat system provides snow-covered area estimates at a spatial resolution of 30 m with a 16-day return interval, while daily estimates of SCA and fractional SCA (f(SCA)) are available at 500 m from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This study describes and tests a linear model to downscale MODIS MOD10A1 f(SCA) (500 m) data to higher-resolution (30 m) spatially explicit binary SCA estimates. The algorithm operates on the assumption that two variables, potential insolation and elevation, control differential ablation of snow cover throughout spring melt at 30 m to 500 m scales. The model downscales daily 500 f(SCA) estimates from MODIS to provide daily SCA estimates at a spatial resolution of 30 m, using limited Landsat SCA for calibration and independent Landsat SCA estimates for validation. Downscaled SCA estimates demonstrate statistically significant improvement from randomly generated model ensembles, indicating that insolation and elevation are dominant factors controlling the snow cover distribution in the semi-arid, mountainous region in southwestern Idaho, USA where this study is performed. Validation is performed with Landsat data not used for calibration, and is also performed using Landsat 500 m aggregate f(SCA) instead of MODIS f(SCA) as an ideal case. Downscaled estimates show reasonable accuracy (test metric outperforms random ensembles at p = 0.01 significance level for multiple ranges of snow cover) with only one calibrated parameter.

	abstract = {There is increasing need to characterize the distribution of snow in complex terrain using remote sensing approaches, especially in isolated mountainous regions that are often water-limited, the principal source of terrestrial freshwater, and sensitive to climatic shifts and variations. We apply intensive topographic surveys, multi-temporal LiDAR, and Random Forest modeling to quantify snow volume and characterize associated errors across seven land cover types in a semi-arid mountainous catchment at a 1 and 4 m spatial resolution. The LiDAR-based estimates of both snow-off surface topology and snow depths were validated against ground-based measurements across the catchment. LiDAR-derived snow depths estimates were most accurate in areas of low lying vegetation such as meadow and shrub vegetation (RMSE = 0.14 m) as compared to areas consisting of tree cover (RMSE = 0.20-0.35 m). The highest errors were found along the edge of conifer forests (RMSE = 0.35 m), however a second conifer transect outside the catchment had much lower errors (RMSE = 0.21 m). This difference is attributed to the wind exposure of the first site that led to highly variable snow depths at short spatial distances. The Random Forest modeled errors deviated from the field measured errors with-a RMSE of 0.09-0.34 m across the different cover types. The modeling was used to calculate a theoretical lower and upper bound of catchment snow volume error of 21-30\%. Results show that snow drifts, which are important for maintaining spring and summer stream flows and establishing and sustaining water-limited plant species, contained 30 +/- 5-6\% of the snow volume while only occupying 10\% of the catchment area similar to findings by prior physically-based modeling approaches. This study demonstrates the potential utility of combining multi-temporal LiDAR with Random Forest modeling to quantify the distribution of snow depth with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

	abstract = {A comprehensive hydroclimatic data set is presented for the 2011 water year to improve understanding of hydrologic processes in the rain-snow transition zone. This type of data set is extremely rare in scientific literature because of the quality and quantity of soil depth, soil texture, soil moisture, and soil temperature data. Standard meteorological and snow cover data for the entire 2011 water year are included, which include several rain-on-snow (ROS) events. Surface soil textures and soil depths from 57 points are presented as well as soil texture profiles from 14 points. Meteorological data include continuous hourly shielded, un-shielded, and wind-corrected precipitation, wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative humidity, dew point temperature, and incoming solar and thermal radiation data. This data is often viewed as "forcing data", and is gap filled and serially complete. Sub-surface data included are hourly soil moisture data from multiple depths from seven soil profiles within the catchment, and soil temperatures from multiple depths from two soil profiles. Hydrologic response data include hourly stream discharge from the catchment outlet weir, continuous snow depths from one location, intermittent snow depths from 5 locations, and snow depth and density data from ten weekly snow surveys. Snow and hydrologic response data are meant to provide data on the catchment hydrologic response to the weather data. This data is mostly presented "as measured" although snow depths from one sensor and streamflow at the catchment outlet have been gap filled and are serially complete. Though the weather, snow, and hydrologic response data only covers one water year, the presentation of the additional subsurface data (soil depth, texture, moisture, and temperature) makes it one of the most detailed and complete hydro-climatic data sets from the climatically sensitive rain-snow transition zone. The data presented are appropriate for a wide range of modeling (energy balance snow modeling, soil capacitance parametric modeling, etc.) and descriptive studies.

	abstract = {The timing, magnitude, and spatial distribution of snow cover and the resulting surface water inputs (SWI) are simulated at a small catchment located in the rain-snow transition zone of southwest Idaho, USA. A physically based snow model is run on this 1.5 ha study catchment, which has an elevation range of 1600-1645 masl. The catchment is divided into relatively steep (mean slope angle of 21 degrees) northeast and southwest facing hill slopes by an ephemeral stream that drains to the southeast. SWI are fundamental controls on soil moisture, streamflow generation, groundwater recharge, and nutrient cycling. Although the timing of melt events is similar across the basin, southwest facing slopes receive smaller magnitude and more frequent SWI from mid winter snow melt, while the northeast facing slope receives greater SWI during the spring. Three spatial patterns are observed in the modeled SWI time series: (1) equal between slopes, (2) majority of SWI on southwest facing slopes, and (3) majority of SWI on northeast facing slopes. Although any of these three spatial patterns can occur during the snow season, four emergent SWI patterns emerge through the melt season: (1) near uniform, (2) controlled by topographic differences in energy fluxes, (3) transitional, and (4) controlled by snow distribution. Rain on snow (ROS) events produce similar SWI between the northeast and southwest facing slopes, with the difference being attributed primarily to snow distribution. Turbulent fluxes dominate the snowpack energetics in four of the five rain on snow events, and advective fluxes from precipitation are greater than 17\% during the 2 rain on snow events in December and January. Net radiation fluxes dominate spring melt events. Variations in the method used to distribute precipitation may result in large differences in total precipitation to the basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

@article{McCreight:2014,
	abstract = {Historically, observing snow depth over large areas has been difficult. When snow depth observations are sparse, regression models can be used to infer the snow depth over a given area. Data sparsity has also left many important questions about such inference unexamined. Improved inference, or estimation, of snow depth and its spatial distribution from a given set of observations can benefit a wide range of applications from water resource management, to ecological studies, to validation of satellite estimates of snow pack. The development of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has provided non-sparse snow depth measurements, which we use in this study, to address fundamental questions about snow depth inference using both sparse and non-sparse observations. For example, when are more data needed and when are data redundant? Results apply to both traditional and manual snow depth measurements and to LiDAR observations. Through sampling experiments on high-resolution LiDAR snow depth observations at six separate 1.17-km(2) sites in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, we provide novel perspectives on a variety of issues affecting the regression estimation of snow depth from sparse observations. We measure the effects of observation count, random selection of observations, quality of predictor variables, and cross-validation procedures using three skill metrics: percent error in total snow volume, root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-2. Extremes of predictor quality are used to understand the range of its effect; how do predictors downloaded from internet perform against more accurate predictors measured by LiDAR? Whereas cross validation remains the only option for validating inference from sparse observations, in our experiments, the full set of LiDAR-measured snow depths can be considered the true' spatial distribution and used to understand cross-validation bias at the spatial scale of inference. We model at the 30-m resolution of readily available predictors, which is a popular spatial resolution in the literature. Three regression models are also compared, and we briefly examine how sampling design affects model skill. Results quantify the primary dependence of each skill metric on observation count that ranges over three orders of magnitude, doubling at each step from 25 up to 3200. Whereas uncertainty (resulting from random selection of observations) in percent error of true total snow volume is typically well constrained by 100-200 observations, there is considerable uncertainty in the inferred spatial distribution (R-2) even at medium observation counts (200-800). We show that percent error in total snow volume is not sensitive to predictor quality, although RMSE and R-2 (measures of spatial distribution) often depend critically on it. Inaccuracies of downloaded predictors (most often the vegetation predictors) can easily require a quadrupling of observation count to match RMSE and R-2 scores obtained by LiDAR-measured predictors. Under cross validation, the RMSE and R-2 skill measures are consistently biased towards poorer results than their true validations. This is primarily a result of greater variance at the spatial scales of point observations used for cross validation than at the 30-m resolution of the model. The magnitude of this bias depends on individual site characteristics, observation count (for our experimental design), and sampling design.

Sampling designs that maximize independent information maximize cross-validation bias but also maximize true R-2. The bagging tree model is found to generally outperform the other regression models in the study on several criteria. Finally, we discuss and recommend use of LiDAR in conjunction with regression modelling to advance understanding of snow depth spatial distribution at spatial scales of thousands of square kilometres.

	abstract = {The spatial pattern of accumulation rate can be inferred from internal layers in glaciers and ice sheets. Non-dimensional analysis determines where finite strain can be neglected ('shallow-layer approximation') or approximated with a local one-dimensional flow model ('local-layer approximation'), and where gradients in strain rate along particle paths must be included ('deep layers'). We develop a general geophysical inverse procedure to infer the spatial pattern of accumulation rate along a steady-state flowband, using measured topography of the ice-sheet surface, bed and a 'deep layer'. A variety of thermomechanical ice-flow models can be used in the forward problem to calculate surface topography and ice velocity, which are used to calculate particle paths and internal-layer shapes. An objective tolerance criterion prevents over-fitting the data. After making site-specific simplifications in the thermomechanical flow algorithm, we find the accumulation rate along a flowband through Taylor Mouth, a flank site on Taylor Dome, Antarctica, using a layer at approximately 100 m depth, or 20\% of the ice thickness. Accumulation rate correlates with ice-surface curvature. At this site, gradients along flow paths critically impact inference of both the accumulation pattern, and the depth-age relation in a 100 m core.},

The two methods are consistent and show that the net accumulation varies from greater than 10 cm a(-1) to about 1 cm a(-1) (ice equivalent) southwest to northeast across the dome. We map the depth of shallow radar layering to interpolate and extrapolate these point-location measurements and show that considerable variations occur over kilometer scales resulting from subtle surface topography.

	abstract = {Measurements of snow using a high-resolution micropenetrometer can be used to discriminate between different snow types; in lower-density snow the signal is sensitive to microstructure, and micromechanical properties can be estimated. Although a physics-based snow penetration theory was first developed almost a decade ago, since that time the majority of studies using snow micropenetrometers have focused on using direct hardness measurements in statistical relationships. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to rigorously test the existing physics-based snow micropenetration theories over a wide range of parameters. These tests revealed four major sources of error in the inversion, which are corrected in this analysis. It is shown that this improved inversion algorithm can recover micromechanical parameters in synthetic data with much greater accuracy over the entire range of micromechanical properties observed in natural snow. Detailed examples of the inversion results are shown for eight different snow types, collected in both Alaskan and alpine snowpacks. The resulting micromechanical properties are distinctly different, indicating that a snow characterization from snow micropenetrometer estimates of micromechanical properties is likely possible. Estimates of the microscale elastic modulus, microscale strength, and structural element length make sense physically when compared to the qualitative descriptions of the different snow types. Microscale strength estimates are used to estimate macroscale strength values, and results from 33 different snow samples, covering a wide range of densities and snow types, are consistent with previously reported values from macroscale tests.},

	abstract = {Lateral downslope flow in snow during snowmelt and rain-on-snow (ROS) events is a well-known phenomenon, yet its relevance to water redistribution at hillslope and catchment scales is not well understood. We used dye tracers, geophysical methods, and hydrometric measurements to describe the snow properties that promote lateral flow, assess the relative velocities of lateral flow in snow and soil, and estimate volumes of downslope flow. Results demonstrate that rain and melt water can travel tens of metres downslope along layers within the snowpack or at the snowpack base within tens of hours. Lateral flow within the snowpack becomes less likely as the snowpack becomes saturated and stratigraphic boundaries are destroyed. Flow along the base can be prevalent in all snowpack conditions. The net result of lateral flow in snow can be the deposition of water on the soil surface in advanced downslope positions relative to its point of origin, or direct discharge to a stream. Although both melt and ROS events can redistribute water to downslope positions, ROS events produced the most significant volumes of downslope flow. Direct stream contributions through the snowpack during one ROS event produced up to 12\% of streamflow during the event. This can help explain rapid delivery of water to streams during ROS events, as well as anomalously high contributions of event water during snowmelt hydrographs. In catchments with a persistent snowpack, lateral redistribution of water within the snowpack should be considered a relevant moisture redistribution mechanism.

	abstract = {The local scale observation site (LSOS) is the smallest study site (0.8 ha) of the 2002/03 Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) and is located within the Fraser mesocell study area. It was the most intensively measured site of the CLPX, and measurements here had the greatest temporal component of all CLPX sites. Measurements made at the LSOS were designed to produce a comprehensive assessment of the snow, soil, and vegetation characteristics viewed by the ground-based remote sensing instruments. The objective of the ground-based microwave remote sensing was to collect time series of active and passive microwave spectral signatures over snow, soil, and forest, which is coincident with the intensive physical characterization of these features. Ground-based remote sensing instruments included frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars operating over multiple microwave bandwidths; the Ground-Based Microwave Radiometer (GBMR-7) operating at channels 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89 GHz; and in 2003, an L-, C-, X- and Ku-band scatterometer radar system. Snow and soil measurements included standard snow physical properties, snow wetness, snow depth transects, and soil moisture. The stem and canopy temperature and xylem sap flux of several trees were monitored continuously. Five micrometeorological towers monitored ambient conditions and provided forcing datasets for 1D snow and soil models. Arrays of pyranometers (0.3-3 mu m) and a scanning thermal radiometer (8-12 mu m) characterized the variability of radiative receipt in the forests. A field spectroradiometer measured the hyperspectral hemispherical-directional reflectance of the snow surface. These measurements, together with the ground-based remote sensing, provide the framework for evaluating and improving microwave radiative transfer models and coupling them to land surface models. The dataset is archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado.},

@article{Heilig:2015,
	abstract = {Evaluating and improving snow models and outflow predictions for hydrological applications is hindered by the lack of continuous data on bulk volumetric liquid water content (theta(w)) and storage capacity of the melting snowpack. The combination of upward looking ground-penetrating radar and conventional snow height sensors enable continuous, nondestructive determinations of theta(w) in natural snow covers from first surficial wetting until shortly before melt out. We analyze diurnal and seasonal cycles of theta(w) for 4years in a flat study site and for three melt seasons on slopes and evaluate model simulations for two different water transport schemes in the snow cover model SNOWPACK. Observed maximum increases in theta(w) during a day are below 1.7vol\% (90th percentile) at the flat site. Concerning seasonal characteristics of theta(w), less than 10\% of recorded data exceed 5 vol\% at the flat site and 3.5vol\% at slopes. Both water transport schemes in SNOWPACK underestimate maximum theta(w) at the flat site systematically for all observed melt seasons, while simulated theta(w) maxima on slopes are accurate. Implementing observed changes in theta(w) per day in outflow predictions increases model performance toward higher agreement with lysimeter measurements. Hence, continuously monitoring theta(w) improves our understanding of liquid water percolation and retention in snow, which is highly relevant for several aspects of the cryosphere such as avalanche formation, catchment hydrology, and ice sheet mass balances.},
